17014,when you create a new object via $database = new mysqldatabase(); the method _construct() isn't invoked and therefore neither is $this->open_connection() and therefore  no value is assigned to the property $connection which remains null and no connection to the mysql server is established.now when you call $database-&gt;query('something'); and there is no database connection mysql_query() tries to establish the default connection as explained at http://docs.php.net/mysql_query:,0

28696,so in your case you're just seeing the very first hello twice due to this.,0
28701,you are going to need to do something more in depth than just a simple array_merge.  the data provider provides an array of which each entry is an individual test case.  each test case is an array containing the arguments.  like so:,0
28702,since you said that you test is being run twice each data provider must be providing only one entry.  array_merge appends the second data provider array to your first array making two test cases.  if you want to combine the data provided by each data provider you will need to do something like the following:,0
28703,this takes the arguments from the second set of data and appends it to the arguments in the first.  now your test will receive the combined arguments from both data providers.,0

33102,"then, the identical operator executes. the handler is just a proxy to the is_identical_function(). now, is_identical will short-circuit if $array is not an array. therefore, it has a best case of o(1). but if $array is an array, it can short-circuit again if the hash tables are identical (meaning both variables are copy-on-write copies of each other). so that case is o(1) as well. but remember that we forced a copy above, so we can't do that if it's an array. so it's o(n) thanks to zend_hash_compare...",0
33103,"note that it looks like they scale the same for references. they don't. they both scale linearly for referenced variables. but the constant factor changes. for example, in a referenced array of size 5, is_array will perform 5 memory allocations, and 5 memory copies, followed by 1 type check. the cast version, on the other hand, will perform 5 memory allocations, 5 memory copies, followed by 2 type checks, followed by 5 type checks and 5 equality checks (memcmp() or the like). so n=5 yields 11 ops for is_array, yet 22 ops for ===(array)...",0

39327,"because, in that case, you are using variables that are not defined, since the form is not submitted initially.",0
39403,with a little trick and with .htaccess you can make this much easier.,0

39424,the only odd thing is that the $flags variable was set to be included as one of the parameters for the str_replace function they are actually not used at all; but i don't know if they are really needed.,0
39427,print_r() will automatically print to the screen. you need to set the second parameter to true to actually capture it in a variable.,0
39461,"as per your comment on this answer... if you want to populate your hidden field then you have to use the javascript created functions, in which these functions will be called whenever there will be a change in the value of select box, the function will fetch the values from all the three select boxes and implode them in your desired format as dd-mm-yyyy.. and populate the hidden field with this newly created value",0
39462,below would be your function it is not the tested one.. but you have to do it like this:,0

39505,"submit: the button submits the form data to the server. this is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value.reset: the button resets all the controls to their initial values.button: the button has no default behavior. it can have client-side scripts associated with the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.",0
39637,also consider breaking out the onclick handler and assigning it from &lt;script&gt; instead of using inline event handler attributes. this tends to be more readable.,0

39694,"alternatively, you could also use array_map(). this is basically the same as a loop except that the looping is not explicitly shown.",0
39697,"note: the loop will still be performed, but it will be hidden inside the aforementioned functions.",0
39823,"it is safer to use first one because you do more checks. most of the time you can find the ip in remote_addr or http_x_forwarded_for if it's going throw proxy, but sometimes you can have in other variables because there is no standard for this.",0

39931,update:if you need to remove the position param you could replace the forloop with list as below:,0
39932,"so you need to call callvisit() by passing two params, the array, result array (where result should be stored)",0

40043,"3) i take it you are using the generated json to send it via ajax to a client. in that case, i would totally cut the fat (eg: generated markup) and send only essentials (picture id, title, fname and whatever else is essential) and generate the code on the client side. this will make your page load faster and save you and your visitors bandwidth.",0
40106,"its already a json? don't do anything with it, insert it as-is. and use bindvalue, bindparam is an optimization thing when you have a lot of data you need to change fast when loop-executing a statement..",0

40530,simply use array_map like as its an array of objects you can simply achieve it like as,0
40597,"before using pdo, i guess you were validating your data (using a validation filter for instance), and then you escaped it before inserting it in your db. now, you only need (but still need) to do the first thing.",0
40602,"none of these is true in this scenario, so you are good here. but if the situation were different, you could consider using the values of the array as keys on another array so that you can check with an amortized cost of o(1) instead of o(n):",0
40607,"of course, you'll have to create the function scrub to scrub your input, but that's outside the scope of the question.",0
40717,"it's just not that simple. you need to get your buttons to submit to a link, and then have the php unset the content.",0

40922,"for the purpose of the function, why not just use array_unique($array)?",0
40923,"ok, since you are trying to learn. here is the explanation for the function in the post",0
40924,"well all this does is to insert the value into the key of an array. since all keys are unique in an array, you will remove all duplicates.",0
40937,"you should actually use a parameter instead of a global variable: function func_readmsg($targetmessage) and function func_delmsg($targetmessage), then pass the value of $targetmessage as a parameter when you call the functions.",0
41043,you don't need to apply stripslashes to data after you fetch it from the database.  the database has not stored the extra escaping characters -- unless you applied double-escaping by mistake.,0
41103,maybe you can answer the question on your own if you know what these functions are intended to be used for:,0

41237,"here's a cleaned-up version with more descriptive variable names, and less code duplication, that you can examine if you need some inspiration.",0
41239,i guess you want to access mysql database installed on different computers on same network as your computer and also on some remote server.,0
41240,what you need is ip addresses of all the computers on which the mysql server is installed including the remote server. and on each such computer mysql server remote access should be enabled for your computer's ip address and mysql user you are using in 'new mysqli_connect()'. see this tutorial.,0
41255,you probably have echo print_r($view). remove the echo construct. and... what need do you have to parse its output? there are certainly much better ways to solve your problem.,0
41258,"right now you seem to be mixing object-oriented and procedural approaches.  if you want to use object-orented approach, mysqli object should be instantiated as follows:",0
41259,"if you want to use procedural approach, mysqli connection resource should be created as follows:",0
41262,"print_r called with one argument (or with its second argument set to false), will echo the representation of its parameter to stdout. if it does this, it returns true. thus if you echo print_r($foo) you will print the contents of foo, followed by a string representation of the return value (which is 1).",0
41341,since you ask about insertion here is the method to prevent sql injection by using this method attacker will have no chance for it.frameworks security.,0
41355,you are doing an assignment instead of comparison. that's the problem with your code.,0
41409,more information about try &amp; catch and how to work with exceptions can be found in the php documentation.,0
41419,"the thing is that 2var.php is already a php script, and it so happens that you don't actually need rewriteengine for this. if you try to visit your script with rewriteengine and its rules disabled, it will work, but produce warning about undefined index: var1.",0
41423,you can parse this with regular expressions in the script itself.,0
41426,"also, i noticed you link to &lt;a href=""2var.php?var1=one&amp;var2=two""&gt;. the point of having rewrite rules is to make urls pretty, so you can directly link to &lt;a href=""2var.php/one/two""&gt; instead (or any other syntax you desire). as long as you back them up with proper rewrite rules, rewrite engine will take care of requests arriving at these addresses and will dispatch such requests to your final scripts.",0
41471,here's a quick tutorial i found to get you started if you don't know about sessions.,0
41495,"you can still loop over the values as you can turn this whole thing in an associative array by passing true to json_decode as a second parameter. i for one am not a big fan of my own answer, and would probably just loop the thing, but it may still answer your question.",0
41558,the explode takes the delimited value off so you would need to re-append it.,0
41672,above answer ashis biswas is fine and you also need to take care that you should check your login session in your controller as in codeigniter you are accessing your controller function instead of view. if you will check and redirect on view page that will not redirect to your login controller even if you have unset  session data.,0
41756,"this will never return true, because the values in your select input in your html code are not the keys of $array, but the values. so $_post[""location""] will always contain a value in $array, not a key. so array_key_exists will always return false in that line of code.",0
41757,"that means the else-block will be executed, which will cause ""error"" to be printed.",0
41758,"did you mean to use in_array($_post[""location""], $array) (php manual) instead, maybe?",0
41767,"also, you don't need an else after a die() statement, as the program has stopped. you can leave your structure like:",0

41841,"when i was facing this problem, it appeared that in several instances, there was actually two cookies by the same name. one of them was the php created cookie, the other was the javascript created cookie. in other instances, there was one cookie, but php would not properly output the updated value until a full page reload had occurred.",0
41842,"it was problematic that the loading of a fresh page which caused the cookie's desired ""new"" value to be read. so one way to deal with php's late cookie update effect is to both use the cookie methods available to it and also just setting $_cookie['yourcookiename'] = $val as well.",0

42904,"if your id is generated from a mysql auto insert id, then you can read the value from $conn->lastinsertid",0
42905,your next problem is how to communicate this securely to the page where the user submits their guestbook comment (in your example code you try to do both operations in the same page).,0
42907,"when you receive the post containing the guestbook data, then you should use an update user set guestbook=:gstbk where id=:id_from_session (or you could insert it into a seperate table with id as a foreign key)",0

42936,"on another note, you don't need to use preg_replace_callback for your substitutions; you can use the captured text in the replacement expression. here's an example from the code formatting regex:",0
42937,"as noted in my comment, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are deprecated; if you are using them to place emphasis on text, you could replace them with &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; respectively; if the markup is solely for presentation, it is better to enclose the text in a &lt;span&gt; element and give it a class which has bold or italic formatting.",0
42943,"a quick explanation of how preg_replace works: when you use parentheses in a regular expression, you capture the matter within those parentheses to the special variables $1, $2, $3, etc. the contents of the first set of parentheses are in $1, the contents of the second set in $2, and so on. for example, take this regular expression:",0
42944,"and the input string bread and butter, bread matches the expression in the first set of parens and butter matches the expression in the second set; $1 would be set to bread and $2 to butter. this becomes useful when we do preg_replace, as we can use $1 and $2 in the replacement string:",0
42946,"in the replacements in your code, the text between the delimiters (* and `) needs to be kept, so it is captured in parentheses; the delimiters themselves are not needed, so they aren't in parentheses.",0
43053,this will save the username to the session so you can then access the username of the user across your php pages for the duration of their session.,0
43093,pretty much what sean said. your call to database::lastinsertid() throws an undefined method error because you haven't defined a method database::lastinsertid(). you need to add the definition to your database class the same as you did with prepare():,0
43178,it looks like to previous server was set with register global on,0
43179,note: this feature has been deprecated as of php 5.3.0 and removed as of php 5.4.0.,0

43188,"it once defaulted to on, but was changed to off in php 4.2. you could still enable it in php.ini. it's been deprecated as of php5.3, and removed in php 5.4.",0
43189,"the issue is not with php or pdo, i was able to reproduce the issue directly with mysql.",0
43203,"however, mysql maintains the state of the database connection, which won't survive the process. each new page requires a new connection to be built, so you can't store a mysql connection in $_session.",0
43206,your solution is to store the database connection parameters and recreate the connection at the top of every page.,0
43216,start up a php session for the logged in usercarry the users id across the mini application so that it can later be inserted in another form and into the database without the user having to type it in themselves,0
43223,you might want to also take a look at this related question php user authentication with sessions,0
43235,"i can tell that $_post is a sort of 'reserved array'. so do not use it as a 'custom array'. it generates automatically when a form ""posts"" its fields' values.",0
43236,then your action.php takes form's values as an array called $_post.,0
43237,"then now, i might answer you that redeclaring $_post as an array sounds purposeless:",0
43238,"however, you might use $_post in this manner into your action.php file, at least treating it as an array:",0
43239,it is not a final solution. take it as a modest $_post explanation.,0
43464,"$_post is an associative array, so you need to be accessing it using single quotes, for example:",0
43593,"your server side code is trying to examine $_post['ptan'], but you haven't sent that in the ajax request.",0
43614,you can try use function addslashes  for prepare data before insert.,0
43747,in the example you link to the author suggests doing this:,0
43748,"note that in the original, the === comparison operator is being used, but in yours you are using ==.",0
43759,but the form is then processed below that.  all that will do each time is reset the value of $_session['form_secret'].  instead that chunk of code needs to be with your html form page.  maybe something like this:,0
43772,"the reason for that is that your array has a hole in it: it has the indices 0 and 2, but misses 1. json can't encode arrays with holes because the array syntax has no support for indices.",0
43773,"you can encode array_values($a) instead, which will return a reindexed array.",0
43774,in addition to the array_values technique it is possible to use array_splice and remove an element and re-index in one step:,0
43866,"i think it's because of your quotes around the set of integers. moreover it is possible you have a typo on your limit syntax. let's use the standard limit :limit offset :offset synthax, more readable and compatible with every database.",0
43914,"your example shows line-breaks within the strings. depending on platform, those can vary. it's perhaps just the case you're looking for a multiline string that is differently encoded within the string of the file you read in and the string you define inside your php code.",0

43985,"the value of table_name is a string, and must therefore be single-quoted in the query. failing to quote it as a string value, mysql assumes that the supplied unquoted $table is a column identifier.",0
43986,if $imgid is also a non-numeric value you'll need to quote that one as well.,0
43987,"we assume it has already been properly filtered against sql injection, if it is the result of user input. i'll note, since the update includes mysqli-specific code, that you really ought to be doing this as a prepared statement rather than a constructed string call to mysqli::query().",0
43988,the error message implies that you have attempted to access the mysqli result property num_rows as a method call with () rather than a property.  you should be using:,0
44167,so after a lot of looking it seems i found the answer in the php manual,0
44269,"after some communication to find out what you want to achieve, here's my answer, which would be too long for a comment.",0
44304,"ok, you want to do a post request with file_get_contents.",0

55226,"it can be confusing to your future self and other maintainers as to where the data is coming from.it can cause collisions, and create hard-to-find bugs in which you are getting the wrong data (because $_request covers $_get, $_post, and $_cookie).",0

55262,printf specifically outputs a formatted string and returns the length of the string.  so this is the equivalent of calling file(integer) where integer is the length of $_post['fname']'s value.,0

58130,"next to that this is also not what the warning precisely wants to tell you. swapping a superglobal like $_get with an equally superglobal function like filter_input(input_get, ...) shows the same design flaw. but netbeans can't warn you as easily about it.",0

65505,"to see what i mean, look at the rendered code of the index.php page. you will see that the form tag renders with action=""add-album.php"" or something similar.  that's why add-album.php loads when you submit.  you may find that setting the action with a static value is what you want.  you left out one important detail - where do you want to send the form data?",0

66080,the reason why the edit button is always getting the last post is because you are overriding the content variable in the session on each loop.,0
66088,"you code must be improved, your logic isn't good. first of all, you don't need to use a session var, one alternative to do this is passing the post id using a get argument, something like this:",0

66548,"btw, a simple way to debug this would be to print out both your data rows and your transliteration array into the same output file using e.g. print_r() or var_dump(), and look at the output to see if the non-ascii characters in it look correct. if the characters look right in the data but wrong in the transliteration table (or vice versa), that's a sign that the encodings don't match.",0

81578,the &amp; is a special character in html which is used to escape special characters (for example to print &lt; in a html page you'd have to write &amp;lt;. it also has a special meaning in urls as a separator for request variables (e.g. http://example.com?foo=bar&amp;braz=omfg) and thus appears a lot in websites. the correct way to write an &amp; within html is &amp;amp;.,0

116530,the side effect of this approach is that you are protected from sql injection.,0

122355,since every user has a role or type it means that the ability of viewing or editing content in your application is solidly connected to this factor. this means that the 2 basic things that your session variables should have are userid and usertype which you should also store in your database,0
122357,"once a user login your initial values are stored to session. in order for your application to know what usera can view or edit in your application, you basically run a comparison in your script against the usertype that usera has. but to achieve what you want you basically need to re-fetch the piece of information in the beginning of every view/page of your application. if new usertype has been assigned to usera simply show a message that he/she will log out automatically in 15 seconds (give time to read the message itself) in order for the changes to take effect. while your user sees this message you take the current session data he/she may have and save it in database, since some session variables might be (or not) available in a upgrade or downgrade of usertype. by placing the comparison of the usertype in the beginning of each view/page of your application you save yourself of the headache that a user can loose data.",0

122692,you need to understand the difference between php sessions and cookies.,0
122693,"cookies are strings that are sent by the server to the browser, and that the browser must send back to the server on every subsequent request, until the cookie expires.for example, if the server responds with a request with the header set-cookie: foo=abc123; expires=wed, 09 jun 2021 10:18:14 gmt, on every subsequent request until 9 june 2012 the browser must send the request header cookie: foo=abc123.on the php script, $_cookie['foo'] will be abc123.",0
122694,"php sessions are based on cookies, but they don't store the values inside a cookie.if you store $_session['foo'] = 'abc123', the server will not send foo=abc123 to the client as cookie, but will rather create a session stored on the server and will send as cookie only the id of the session.so, when you call session_start(), php generates a new session on the server, with an auto-generated id (if you're interested, you can read the id with session_id()). it will then send (automatically) a cookie to the client similar to phpsessid=php_session_id_here. all of this is done automatically by php, and you don't need to worry about that.",0
122695,"at the end of this story, yes, your code is safe. that is because you're not setting a cookie authenticated=pass (which will be insecure, as clients can easily overwrite cookies), but you're instead storing that value in the php session storage and the client sees only the session id.",0
122696,"ps: instead of just storing a boolean 'authenticated', you may want to store more useful information in the session, like the user id of the authenticated user in the database or anything else that can be meaningful.",0
122697,"ps2: php sessions have legacy support for browsers that do not have cookies enabled, but in 2015 that's meaningless (i wonder who still disables cookies! - if you do that, 90% of the websites will stop working). as a consequence, you should ensure that you have these two ini settings: (docs: http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-cookies )",0

15501,plus you can remove the htmlspecialchars() functions as they are only useful when looking at echoing html code to the browser - as you are uploading an image (not html code...) there is no need for any of the variables to be compared with this function in the first place. even then you would only use htmlspecialchars() when writing to the web-page to be seen by users.

17735,"yes, it seems to be correct. basically you specify an array to array_unique and it gives you unique items out of the array.",1
17747,i use the php function isset() to check if a post was sent or not,1
17907,"secondly, codeigniter does not utilize php's native $_session, they implement their own. so you should not test if it is set with &lt;?php if (isset($_session['fail'])): ?&gt;",1
18039,however i won't show you how to fix this because you're using deprecated mysql_* functions in your code.  you need to switch to mysqli or to pdo.  there are plenty of tutorials on how to use those libraries.,1
18190,first off you should be using the intval() function php provides to safely cast a string as an integer.,1
18191,"secondly if you want numbers like 0.01 or 0.999 you need a float, integers do not have decimals, so you should actually be using floatval().",1
18224,"simple answer, yes. if any part of your sql statement comes from a request or form submission by the client, you need to sanitize/escape it.",1
18251,nb: it is better to use mysqli or pdo instead of mysql since mysql is officially deprecated since php 5.5,1
18488,also you could install the php module xdebug which could modify the output of var_dump for better readability: http://xdebug.org/docs/display,1

18644,btw.some tips for the future:1. the id's fields should have unique values.2. you should consider protecting your query from sql attacks. here you do not even escape the string which is given by the user.3. as far as i remember the mysql is obsolete so try to use mysqli instead.,1
18681,1- check if you make session start  session_start(); in the begining of your review.php file,1
18701,"i i completely agree that pdo is good choice to avoid sql injections but, you know at such situations you are unable to debug your queries. but if you use mysqli wisely and properly check sql injections when you input, then there will not be a problem.",1
18785,and try to avoid using mysql_* functions due to they are deprecated.instead use mysqli_* functions or pdo statements.,1
18817,use php sessions instead of cookies. the session variables are server-side. php will automatically handle the session management. you can also overload its functionality if you want more control.,1
18819,"for extra safety, you should store the remote address that was used to login, and compare it on each page load. this is to make sure that nobody hijacked the session id and is pretending to be logged in from another location.",1

18890,"i would recommend using jquery to listen for events as well. the events api for jquery will let you listen for events on objects. so, something like this:",1
19170,first you have to check to use mysqli or pdo instead of mysql.,1
19172,when using mysqli you should use mysqli_prepare and mysqli_stmt_bind_param instead of using the php variables directly in your sql string. this will help you to avoid sql injection.,1
19328,"your code is prone to sql injection, you are still using mysql even though it has been deprecated, you should use either mysqli or pdo with prepared statements.",1
19579,i'd  say you think it is false because the string's position might be 0 which evaluates to false (assuming you are using a needle that is present in the string). you should always compare with ===.,1

19641,"htmlentities() will convert a number of non-ansi characters (i assume this is what you mean by utf-8 data) to entities (which are represented with just ansi characters). however, it cannot do so for any characters which do not have a corresponding entity, and so cannot guarantee that its return value consists only of ansi characters. that's why i 'm suggesting to not use it.",1
19659,to prevent against any sql injection you should use mysqli_real_escape_string or you can use prepared statements that accomplish the same thing.,1
19870,"you should be able to use ifnull to convert nulls to (say) empty strings in your where clause.  for example, name like '%%%s%%' would become ifnull(name, '') like '%%%s%%'.",1

20436,"yes, you can. as far as i know pdo is completely object-oriented, but you may want to look into mysqli which allows both procedural and oo styles.",1
20469,"however, there is much bigger problem in this code. you don't escape the values, therefore open an sql injection. just think what would happen if your password contains a single quote, such as test'123:",1

41339,use prepared statements and parameterized queries. these are sql statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. this way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious sql.,1
41357,"this (mysql_*) extension is deprecated as of php 5.5.0, and will be removed in the future. instead, the mysqli or pdo_mysql extension should be used. switching to prepared statements is even more better to ward off sql injection attacks !",1

41408,you need to have a try block before you can add a catch block. you will need to change your code to something like this:,1
41507,ok i solve this problem. the problem is codeigniter does not accept array of pairs when unset session data. i.e,1
41783,you might also want to have a look either at pdo and prepared statements that replace mysql_ functions.,1
41917,add a session_start() at the begining of your code and $_session to manipulate it or create it.,1

42903,"regarding the sql injection problem, there are 2 methods to protect your system - one is to transform the data in which a way that it cannot break the sql string it is added to (e.g. using mysqli_real_escape_string()) but the recommended approach when using pdo to mediate your code's interaction with the dbms is to use variable binding. here you compose your sql command with placeholders for the data and substitute them at run time.",1
42906,"sending it in a round trip to the browser, as a cookie or as form variable means that it could be tampered with. there are esoteric stateless solutions where you can do this but with the data encrypted or cryptographically signed,  however the simplest solution is to use sessions - add session_start() at the top of all your pages and any data you want available across requests can be stored in the $_session superglobal.",1
43052,"put session_start(); at the top of your php file. then when they successfully log in, you can do this:",1

43220,in order to have access to the session array you must call session_start(); before accessing the $_session array.  remember to only call session_start only once per php execution.  if session_start is called multiple times is will generate a warning or an error (i don't remember which),1
43221,you can check if the $_session array is set to know if the session has been started,1

58136,the reason why you must use array_merge and not array_unshift is because the latter only works on numerically indexed arrays.,1
58143,"note: when using array_merge the items with the same keys from the second array will overwrite the ones from the first one, so if 'front' already exists in $queue it will not be overwritten, but only brought to the front. on the other hand if you use +, the new value will be present in the result and be at the front.",1

60448,note - you are using the old obsolete mysql_* functions rather than the current mysqli_* functions (or the pdo equivalents). i would advise you to swap over. this would also allow you to use parameterised queries which are safer. your current query is wide open to sql injection attacks.,1
60618,"second, the query above gives back a one-row result set. you need to actually read that row. i'm not going to tell you how to do that using mysql_ because only a fool uses mysql_ these days. please, please use pdo or mysqli_.",1
60695,always use mysql_real_escape_string instead of addslashes. make sure you are connected to the database before running it otherwise you will error.,1

61016,you can get the base url using $_server['http_host'] you may need to append http/https to the string.,1
61017,you can also then use $_server['request_uri'] to get the remainder of the url.,1

61838,the error suggests that select() is called on a null object. do a var_dump() on your parent::$db and make sure that the object is not actually empty.,1
62057,you probably want to call session_start() before the $_session variable will be available.,1
62207,you should be using php pdo library http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php or at least mysqli http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php,1

62869,unless you specify when the cookie is to expire it will automatically expire when the browser window is closed. the third parameter of setcookie() allows you to specify the expiration of the cookie:,1
63070,to add another value of an array is to use array_push and to delete it you can use unset. see the example below.,1
63147,you can use (in_array) function to check if var in array or not,1
63314,make sure you do similar escaping for all of the input you're using in the query.,1
63429,since you are using pdo(a very good job there =) ) you can't call mysql_* functions.,1
63430,you need to pass pdo::fetch_assoc as parameter to be able to retrieve the data using named indexes.,1
63670,"furthermore, i don't think you should be adding slashes to the content and directly insert the values in a query, instead consider using parameters. read up on php data objects (pdo: http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) which is a very nice and safe (if used properly!) extension for interacting with a database.",1

64015,"session_start must be called before you read from -or write to- the $_session variable. in the second page ""error page"", you placed session_start but after you tried to read the $_session var, so place it in the top of that ""error page"" instead of the middle.",1
64129,you must use cookie instead of session. in most cases (it depends of php settings) the session will have limited lifetime.,1
64153,"when you want to execute a query, first make sure it will run by making it not equal or equal to false. that way you can debug your script. try to prepare the query alone instead of executing it right away.",1

64942,"so the first thing i'd recommend is to stop using the mysql_xxx() functions, and switch to using the pdo library instead. the old mysql functions are deprecated anyway, so it's not recommended to use them if at all possible, but in this case there's a specific reason for using pdo instead because it has significant performance benefits over the old functions.",1
64943,pdo allows you to use a feature called prepared queries allows the database to cache queries more efficiently if you to call similar queries repeatedly.,1
65024,i advice you to start learning mysqli or pdo since mysql functions are retarded and no longer maintained,1
65195,"php is separate from js, but you can 'echo' to javascript from php the same way you would normally do with html. remember that session_start has to be the first thing ever in your code, as it sets some headers.",1

65287,"if your field is an integer, consider using an int cast (int) before appending the value to the query. do however note that all other variables must be escaped before appending them to the query, because one of them might contain a string that invalidates the query.",1
65289,"__construct and __destruct are called every time a script is ran with an instance of that object.  if you put an object in a session, that object does not hold the same value across page views, it is simply an object.  i wrote a quick example to demonstrate this:",1

65304,"in the other hand, $user = $_post['user'] and $passwd = $_post['passwd']; are parameters for a query, which can be subject to sql injection if no validations are applied before adding them to the query. in this case, the best approach is using parametrized queries, instead of using concatenation when building sql queries.",1
65337,"also, another option is to switch to pdo, which is a bit nicer, as it supports named parameters and more databases. here's a comparison between mysqli and pdo.",1
65453,if you are not going to change to mysqli or pdo with prepared statements ( which mitigate against sql injection ) then at least ensure you filter any data received from your users - for instance mysql_real_escape_string offers at least some protection.,1
65503,"the action of the form is the address of the current script because you set it to $_server['php_self'].  it's a little tricky, though - it's going to be the script that runs that code, which may or may not be the one loaded directly by the browser.",1
65602,"secondly, by putting $_post values directly in the query like that you are opening yourself up to all sorts of injection attacks. you need to make sure that you are escaping any data properly to prevent that.",1
65751,"one thing both methods push heavily is prepared queries. without using a prepared query, you're leaving yourself vulnerable to sql injection. a prepared query binds the parameters being passed through, so they can't be manipulated.",1

66428,firstly you have to know about implode() function. mainly the implode() function returns a string from the elements of an array.,1
66506,"first, the mysql api you are using is deprecated and will eventually be removed.  it is recommended you switch to mysqli or pdo for any new development.",1
66516,you must then bind the paramter to your select statement.  here is why it would be best to switch to mysqli or pdo because the mysql_* functions in php do not support prepared statements and parameterized queries.  read more at how can i prevent sql injection in php?,1

67391,edit:i forgot to mention: the best is to use pdo(php data objects) -> http://de.php.net/pdo,1
67394,actually mysql_real_escape_string() is used while sanitize a input from a user. so you should (at least) use it everywhere a user can input anything that goes into a query. it is also very suggested to use prepared statements.,1
67540,"then you should note that even with mysqli::real_escape_string(), it's not secure against sql injection, and that you should use parameterized queries. an example of that is given below.",1
67543,also note that storing passwords in plain-text is a big no. you should use functions like password_hash() / password_verify() to properly and securely store your users passwords.,1
68121,it must be $_request and not $_requests.also beware of sql injection since you are directly using the values.use prepare statemnts to prevent sql injnection.,1
68663,for performance reasons you should probably select only the needed columns in the query. and it is heavily recommended to use pdo or mysqli instead of the mysql_-functions as they are deprecated as of php 5.5.,1
68766,"also, mysql_* functions are deprecated. if you want to get hacked, that's cool. if not, maybe look into pdo instead.",1
69091,"prepared statements (via mysqli or pdo) can be useful if you are doing lots of high volume queries that all use the prepared statement. the prepared statements are faster, additionally you don't have to worry about things like escaping data with prepared statements but they take a bit of code overhead so for a simple app sometimes it's not worth using prepared statements and using the old mysql_* functions are easier for the intended purpose.",1
69351,"php://input is a read-only stream that allows you to read raw data from the request body. in the case of post requests, it is preferable to use php://input instead of $http_raw_post_data as it does not depend on special php.ini directives.",1

80364,"you should always sanitize input. a good starting point is filter_var(). using the right flags for validation and sanitization and makes your input save(r). keep in mind that filter_validate_* only tells you if something is valid, while filter_sanitize_* actually cleans your data from unwanted and potentially malicious data.",1

105179,"don't use mysql_*() for new code - it's depracated. switch to mysqli_*() or pdo now.your code is susceptible to sql injection. escape your input variables with mysql_real_escape_string() (or the mysqli equivalent) or better, switch to prepared statements.",1
105658,"if your other script happens to be using this word as a column reference, you will need to set it inside backticks, since key is a mysql reserved word. i'm just thinking outloud here.",1
105659,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help during production testing.,1
106281,"sidenote: don't use mysql_* functions, they are deprecated as of php 5.5 and are removed altogether in php 7.0. use mysqli or pdo instead. and this is why you shouldn't use mysql_* functions.",1
106733,really you should be using parameter placeholders (?) for the values and prepare the statement with pdo or equivalent.,1
106859,also use mysqli instead of mysql to avoid sql injection.,1
107070,but you have to initialize session_start(); in all web pages where you have need to access that session variables.,1
107090,"strpos will return 0 if the needle is at the very start of the haystack. but 0 evaluates to boolean false, so your if condition fails.",1
108041,you should use mysqli_connect instead of mysql_connect which is deprecated since php 5.5.0 :,1
108647,i highly recommend looking into using a pdo connection because it will be much more portable and parameterized queries pretty much eliminate security issues if used properly.,1
108648,"all mysql_* functions are going to be deprecated as well so you should invest your time in learning the newest standards. a mechanic is not going to focus on learning carborated engines, they are going to focus on fuel-injection systems.",1

109199,"as i stated in comments, you need to start the session first and placed on top before anything is happening or meant to happen.",1
109429,you can use array_values (to get the values and ignore the keys).,1
109915,you have to use array_search() instead of in_array() to get the key of the found element.,1
110016,"fixed it. all i needed to do was add make sure the session_start() was at the start of each page that used it before the output, other wise it wouldn't work.",1
110449,it is very important to use mysqli_* functions not mysql_* ones (they are deprecated) or even better pdo. at least sanitize and validate your inputs so your data will be as valid as you can.,1

110806,"to use the php $_session variables, just add session_start() at very top of all php scripts. note that session_start() must be the first instruction -- if any other php headers are sent, session_start() will not work.",1
110808,"therefore, have your other php file also test the $_session['submitted'] variable (again, session_start() is required up top) to ensure it is okay to run the db insert.",1
111344,you can check email field is not empty and then you can use filter_var to validate provided email.,1
111920,"in addition, your code is highly insecure. at least use mysql_real_escape_string(), e.g. $name=mysql_real_escape_string($_request['req-name']); to protect against sql injection.",1
112005,you need to call session_start() whenever you are using session. you don't need to check session_id().,1
112077,another option is to use __dir__ or dirname(__file__) depending on the php version you are using. either of those two ways will return the folder name where the file that is executed by php resides in.,1

116002,use the mysqli or the pdo extension instead of the old mysql extension.,1
116423,"whenever you concatenate in a sql query you should be using a prepared statement instead, as it opens you application to sql injection attacks. now that i look closer you are using escape_string while this is good, the preferred way is prepared statements. this is because with a prepared statement, the variables are entirely separate from the query commands and so the db knows not to execute anything in them.  even with escaping there could be edge cases that may be an issue, i don't know of any per-say, but something like using a hexadecimal version of a quote are things i have seen in examples, or weird character strings that the db would see as a quote.",1
116674,before accessing $_session you first need to initialise session using session_start(); on the top of the page,1

117565,you may need to add session_start() to the top of the file.,1
117824,for your project you'll want to get the url from the header then tart a database connection.insert the url into the database. close the connection. no sanitation is necessary for pdo because it uses prepared statements.,1
118084,"you would have ensured that ?problem_id= is numeric. all of your other fields may still be at risk though, so this isn't the proper way of securing against sql injection. you should look into pdo and mysqli, and their bindparam/bind_params functions.",1

119434,try using mysqli::multi_query() instead of mysqli::query(). it allows the execution of multiple queries at once.,1
119455,"also, you should be passing the login name using a paramaterized statement to avoid an obvious security hole.",1

120411,in order to make dealing with the session possible add session_start(); to the top of your script.,1
120412,the simple answer is that you need to put session_start() at the top of the script (and the top of any script that uses the session variables).,1
120416,"you should also look into binding parameters in queries, which would allow you to avoid having to think about escaping values before running queries.",1
121137,for security reasons i also suggest you use pdo instead of mysql functions and $_post instead of $_request (in case you are not already sending your form per post).,1
121172,"there's nothing special whatsoever about post requests and sessions.you just need to call session_start at the top of every file request you want to use sessions in, that's it.",1
121345,you really should be using something like filter_var() or parse_url() instead of regexes for url validation.,1
121561,"the leading concept in programming is ""don't trust user input"". so the main problem in your case is not a special character its how you work with your data. so you shouldn't use a path given by a user because the user can manipulate the path or other variables.",1
121562,to escape a user input to prevent bad characters you can use htmlspecialchars or you can filter your get input with filter_input something like that:,1
121609,"yes. always. or, better yet use placeholders (which are available in both pdo and mysqli) see best way to stop sql injection in php.",1
121612,"the user enters data. the database stores the data. the point of ""escaping"" the data (or, better yet, use placeholders/parameterized queries) is making sure the data makes it into the database correctly and safely. if the data needs to be treated specially, then handle this at the data level -- the actual operation of dealing with the sql should be simple, consistent, and reliable. (note that mysql_real_escape_string doesn't change the data seen by the database, rather it ensures that the data is the real data -- that which was passed to the mysql_real_escape_string function -- after the database parses the sql command.)",1
121822,"however, you probably want to use empty() instead of isset(). if a variable exists and contains an empty string, isset() will still return true, which probably isn't what you want. you probably want this:",1
122226,"array_filter is used for filtering out elements of an array based on whether they satisfy a certain criterion. so you create a function that returns true or false, and test each element of the array against it. your function will always return true, since every array has a first element in it, so the array is unchanged.",1
122227,"what you're looking for is array_map, which modifies each element in an array by running the callback over it.",1
122444,you have to pay attention to the comparison operator: using $pos != false is not enough because 0 == false. you have to compare using === or !== to avoid this.,1

124981,"$_post is an array, you access arrays with [], so:",1
125002,i think the value for the $_post['color'] should be read only after checking if its set.,1
125312,empty() will return false if there is no assignment to that variable.,1
125418,you are misunderstanding how in_array works. in_array checks the values. you want to check the keys.,1
125734,to remove duplicate values then we can use array_unique() function. the functionality of it is to accept an array and returns another array without duplicate values.,1
126189,persistent connections are a good idea only when it takes a (relatively) long time to connect to your database. nowadays that's almost never the case. the biggest drawback to persistent connections is that it limits the number of users you can have browsing your site: if mysql is configured to only allow 10 concurrent connections at once then when an 11th person tries to browse your site it won't work for them.,1
126208,array_intersect_key() is a suitable call to filter an array using another array's keys.,1
126778,"pdo supports more than one database backend. this helps should one of your clients request a port of your application to a different database.prepared statements in pdo support named placeholders in addition to the positional (?) placeholders that mysqli supports.pdo supports binding a single parameter at a time instead of all parameters at once. this allows stepping through an array of arguments and binding each, instead of having to construct a type string and then use call_user_func_array() black magic.pdo supports a convenient shortcut by passing an array to $stmt-&gt;execute(), where each key's value is bound to the placeholder as the key. (caveat: it casts each value to a string, so you have to bind one at a time if your statement has a variable limit. this is documented, and there's a feature request to change this casting to string.)",1

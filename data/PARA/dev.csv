110844,"then access the folder from the root directory. for example:href=""http://&lt;?php echo $_server['http_host'] ?&gt;/demo/assets/css/style.css""href=""http://&lt;?php echo $_server['http_host'] ?&gt;/demo/contents/test.php""",0
111381,"since the id keys are different, you cannot use array comparison functions and operators directly. i would recommend simply iterating the array and comparing the keys:",0
111650,"it must be added at the top of the php page and once the work is done, destroy the session:",0
111651,"the above code for closing database connection is for php pdos. if you are using mysqli, use:",0
111715,"then when the form is submitted, you can access the value of thought_id using $_post for your query (also cleaned it up a bit):",0
111880,"5a - you changed from a hard coded pipeno dropdown, back to the dynamically dropdown using the function. so you are missing the javascript - onchange=check();5b - now that you are creating your pipeno &amp; onchange=check(); dynamically, you have to change your check() function to get the id dynamically as well.",0
111881,"6 - $php_self is not valid. i think you were trying for $_server['php_self'], but this is easily hacked, so it is better just to use action="""". [6.1,6.2,6.3]",0
111883,"8 - if you have 3 forms on the same page, each one has to have a different name, or you will not be able to tell which submit button was clicked. [8.1,8.2,8.3]",0
111919,you are trying to execute an update query based on an insert's format. check the update query format.,0
112004,"you need to call session_start() on the iframe code too, are you actually calling it ?",0
112440,"firstly, make sure your markup is valid. note that you have some spaces where there should not be spaces (e.g. name =""name""). at a minimum you should have a blank html document, with your contents inside a &lt;body&gt; tag:",0
112638,"you have to use mysqli here, because you used mysqli dor db connection",0
112708,"1. $_post array does not contain $_post['fruit_list'] 2. first answer is ""no"".a variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false. empty() does not generate a warning if the variable does not exist.see in php.net 3. empty checks if the variable is set and if it is it checks it for null, """", 0, etc.  isset just checks if is it set, it could be anything not null. see",0
112925,"a reference in php means, that in your case $_session['email'] has become an alias for some other variable. if that other variable is changed, $_session['email'] will change as well as it's only an alias.",0
112948,"you did require_once config.php, which means, it will only be included once (in the first condition)you did close the mysqli connection on the first condition, so mysqli is not accessible anymore after that.",0
113307,"the problem is apparently that with ajax you are not going to be sent to another php page, so i couldn't see the echo $_post['work_id'];. but now it works, it was the data problem…",0
113440,you don't have table name in your query! also do not use quotation in your column name :),0
114127,you don't need to explode or something else. you could get image extension by path_info() php function. please have a look on below.,0
114345,"so the only thing that can go wrong is that jquery only gathers part of the data and then makes a post request. using just $.post('save.php', data) as you mentioned, that wont happen. its either working to gather the data or its waiting for a response from the server.",0
114346,"if you switch sites during the gathering, there wont be a request. and if you switch after the request has been made and you move away quickly, before all data has been transmitted, the apache server will see it as half a request and wont invoke php.",0
114509,"if you have magic_quotes_gpc on in your php configuration (it's on by default in php &lt; 5.4), you need to call stripslashes on any variables in $_post or $_get.",0
114637,"you can estimate the correct answer based on your knowledge of your specific folder and web structure, but that is far from a general solution. but i would recommend you to use a boostrap file that is the entry point for each ""page"". there you can setup you $basepath variable and other needed values.",0
114687,this also presumes all fields were integers as your original queries did. if they are not the inputs should be surrounded by single quotes.,0
114766,what you are doing with your code is that if a $_request of action equals value duplicate then you are doing the following things:,0
114901,"the value exists in the $_get array but his value is null,the function isset only evaluate if the value is initialized, not if the value is truthy.",0
114998,"you are using a custom mail header from. do not use this. from is used in spam filters. if i would enter my mail address, and you are sending this mail with from: my@mail, you are impersonating my own email server. spam used to use this to hide the real source, and to redirect complaints and error feedback to the unhappy guy behind that mail address. because of this today there are mechanisms that will prevent such abuse. so just do not pretend i am sending this mail - you do.",0
114999,"if you want to be able to answer me with a click on the reply button, use the reply-to header, but always use from: dont-answer@yourwebsite.example.",0
115197,consider also using something like pdo - mysql and mysqli extensions are both deprecated &amp; removed come php7 (see the deprecation notice at the top of the page).,0
115218,a quick look at the class shows you can't do that.,0
115424,you can take a look at my pdo implementation example on github:https://github.com/maartensch/database-pdo-mysql-class-php,0
115450,"if you are not using mysqli after all, know that the code that you wrote is not working because of 2 issues:",0
115842,"if you don't exit() after the redirect, the user can choose to ignore the redirect and thus bypass your login system and receive the protected page contents.",0
115916,"drop the mysql library and move your code to pdo, you won't look back.",0
115967,and if you want that data in the comma separated list then it try implode,0
115975,i've never liked array_push() and never use it.  that's invalid syntax and you can't use array_push() to specify a key.  to specify a key:,0
116391,"in your form you have &lt;select name='test[$id]'&gt; (one for each item), then when you submit the form you are getting $tests = $_post[""test""]; you don't need to specify the index in the form and can simply do &lt;select name='test[]'&gt;, you can eventually add a hidden field with the id with &lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""$id""/&gt;. the second part is the verification wich is not good at the moment; you can simply check if the itemalready exist in the database with a query",0
116440,"3) once the files have been properly modified, all you have to do is properly configure laravel to use your custom connection by modifying the following file:",0
116527,"what you really want to do is check the value of mycount in the result set, and if it is 1 then there was a match, and if it is a 0 there was not a match.",0
116648,"both contain the oci (oracle call interface) term because both make use internally of the oci api provided by oracle. as such, you need the oracle instant client no matter what library you choose. but you then need to install the corresponding php packages.",0
116649,"in your case, you're installing oci8 and then trying to run pdo code.",0
116757,"that function expects a string. when you feed it an array, it will convert it to the string ""array"". the same applies to all the child arrays.  you're using mysql_escape_string on arrays.",0
116758,"what you want to do instead, since you seem to have an array of children, is to loop through that array and pick up each child's info to add to the email.",0
116839,"unless you are running facebook i doubt that strlen will be where your server will spend most of his resources, and you should keep using strlen.",0
117120,then you have the third case and need to filter the html.,0
117122,"if you want the outputted data to be treated as html by the browser then no, htmlspecialchars is not the solution.",0
117408,so lets get to your data... what we will eventually need in order to run the sql statement is an array that looks like this:,0
117594,if you want to send email on $_post['mail'] then use following.,0
117652,"try this by concatenating the value in the string via php,",0
117666,"you need to serialize all your inputs/quantities if you will have the same name ""qty"" in all fields. i will update my answer later if you do t get answer about this.",0
117703,"first: use brackets! they are there for a good reason, then your if would expand to:",0
117811,your print_r($_get) is not querying / getting anything. you need to specify what $_get is looking for.,0
117823,here is a more in depth guide: pdo tutorial 2,0
117983,"ultimately, as @stephen noted, it is better to use an object for the data field, as it is arguably more elegant. data: {'id': id} should work as well, and you can add more variables in the future.",0
118008,"so if your color.choices file has these options below. then your array will start at 0,1,2 as i used above for your colors e.g. $contents[0] would be the colors line. $content[1] would be the shape line. etc. and then you would still have to explode them into a new var.",0
118090,but it doesn't have anything to do with you errors.,0
118091,"not sure about the missing argument error, but it seems like you have an argument defined in userdata, but calling it without the argument.",0
118391,"mysql_real_escape_string($str)mysql_real_escape_string(addcslashes($str, ""%_""))htmlspecialchars($str)json_encode() - only for utf8! i use my function for iso-8859-2mysql_real_escape_string(addcslashes($str, '^.[]$()|*+?{}')) - you cannot use preg_quote in this case because backslash would be escaped two times!preg_quote()",0
118580,"as you can see, there is no id value (or any other value).  that would look something like this instead:",0
118700,"but do you really want the user to be able to input markup for all fields, including their name and e-mail address? should i be able to have the name “edward boing jr”? are users going to have to enter &amp;amp; every time they want to use an ampersand?",0
118701,"a better approach is usually to accept plain text as it is, and then html-escape it at the point you insert it into an html page (eg with &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($value); ?&gt;) so that the exact string entered by the user appears in the page. the fields where you deliberately allow markup (and so use htmlpurifier instead of htmlspecialchars) are typically very much exceptional cases.",0
118718,"i also suggest, for really complex, nested structures, to comment what each ending bracket goes to like i did in your code. i put comments so that i could see exactly what the } was ending.",0
118785,"as long as you explicitly set the character set of the connection object, you should be fine:",0
118786,"the same problem with the character set applies to pdo prepared statements, so pdo is the recommended way, but it does not make you safe in this case.",0
118837,"the print_r function has a boolean option that allows it to be returned as a string variable, rather than print it to the screen. it's usage is something like:",0
118883,"you need to research the lifecycle of a php request. when you submit your ajax request, the success callback is called with one argument contained the output you expect:",0
118891,"now why the second time does pdf.php not return the value it returned the first you ask? because http is a stateless protocol. that means one request to pdf.php is entirely different from another. without the use of get, post, or session variables (cookies included), one request to pdf.php has no knowledge to any other requests to pdf.php.",0
118893,"also, i believe you are misusing ajax in this instance. the intent of ajax is to perform requests to the server without having to navigate to a new page. you should either perform the ajax request and then take the returned data and inject it into the current page (you can use the first parameter passed to the success function) or forego ajax altogether and just redirect to pdf.php.",0
118919,so basically you need to find a way to pass correct value there.,0
118920,"edit: as for your comment, the script that you posted doesn't seem to store 'activityeventid' in the session as the lines you quoted are actually commented on the script that you posted in question.",0
119020,of course you'll have to replace the $variable_that_has_id with whatever $row[] correlates with the id in your database.,0
119021,"after that you can create a submit button, then use the form to post data to the same page(or a different one) and you can use the $_post variable to grab whatever values were checked and submitted with the form.",0
119025,"if you want to allow the user to only select one option change the input type to ""radio""",0
119095,"if you want sessions destroyed after a specific period of time, then you should store a timestamp, and then use that timestamp and the presence of the session to see if the session is still alive.  something like this:",0
119112,"first off, you need to understand that a character with a diacritic like &#243; or &#238; (from your example) is not automatically a ""utf-8 character"". it is simply a character that has different encodings (if any) in different character sets, even in those character sets that have the basic single-byte ascii part in common (i.e., the english alphabet, the digits, the most common punctuation, and a few more). you could call it a ""problematic character"", but not a ""utf-8 character"".",0
119270,$row[0] should be an int type in order to get proper results.,0
119304,if you do the preg_replace on the full string you only need to make one regex call.then instead of explode and implode i use str_replace to add the li tags.,0
119454,"it's also unclear what your global $db is about. i hope that's psuedo code. if that is your literal code, then you have a clear bug in that you aren't even attempting to connect to the database.",0
119897,"you may be able utilize multi-part http responses to send back multiple images, but browser support could be problematic (see: this question from a few years back).",0
120000,as there is no element bearing that value and nothing inside that conditional statement will execute.,0
120004,"also this name=""post_title"" seems related to $_post['title'] and doesn't match. therefore, you need to make them match in array names.",0
120163,"note that you should avoid unnecessary loops that suggested in the other answer, as it will complicate the code with no reason.",0
120177,i don't know what you mean by merge them into one; the second snippet is an extension (and improvement) of the first.,0
120190,"i will run a very quick example, but i think you'll need to read up on the differences between mysql and mysqli (there are many websites with good advise, please google)",0
120191,your mysqli would be best in the form of object orientated and you would have a mysqli object which contains your connection data:,0
120197,"so this will now have a name value array of results from the $result array, each initial row will correspond to each initial row of the $parameters query. to reverse the array as you want you can still array_reverse but the data is selected by name, and should be referenced as such.",0
120199,"there are a lot of mistakes in your code. some of them are already noted. you should use ""==="" and it's good to trip line-ending symbols. but main problem as i see is that you check in for loop, but exiting after very first string that does not contain correct name instead of processing all of them.",0
120370,i just how to fix this problem. this worked for me you can give it a try:just change,0
120735,"look at your print_r() and check carefully how sub array are build. e.g. if you want to print name of each tweet author, you should modify yor echo in foreach to:",0
121018,"so along with the quantity controls (added by show_quantity_box()) and the submit button, you can see a load of other data being passed. among this data is func=""cartadd"" and product_id=[product id].",0
121048,"if you have excluded 0 as a valid number for your integer id, you can simply do the following:",0
121052,"if you then need to actually validate the input more strictly, you can turn it back into a string for comparison reasons:",0
121055,it's not pretty; but you can make use of the php array functions to perform this action:,0
121069,"the [ ] usually show optional parameters. so the [, is saying you could, but don't have to do array_slice($array, $offset, $length) the $length parameter is optional.",0
121136,this way you don't overwrite the file ending with jgp even it is a png.,0
121175,if you're wanting to get values from a $_post you could relate the two together by :,0

121334,it looks like you are missing session_start() at the beginning of both files.,0
121344,"it's not working because somewhere in the regex you are asking for a dot in between http:// and /. http://localhost/whatever has no dot, so it fails.",0
121458,"instead, the solution was to add this line to the bottom of my localsettings.php file:",0

121767,"just use $array=explode('/',$string).  the explode function does the splitting and returns the array that you want.",0
121769,"also, if it's always going to be an integer, you could use:",0
121770,but you would need to be careful with things that evaluate to 0 and check for it in your if statement:,0
121772,"for instance, your php code is using get, but your code here is not including the gid in the action attribute. (also, you really should use two different forms for this, imo.)",0
121777,"because if that's the case, what you have to do is create a hidden input with your gid value so it can be available in $_post.",0
121829,"make sure you have proper indentation, or else you are going to get lost quickly. i have cleaned up most of your code. you were hard coding ""str"" in your url instead of concatenating the variable:",0

126190,pdo does not manage the persistence. the mysql driver does. it reuses connections when a) they are available and  the host/user/password/database match. if any change then it will not reuse a connection. the best case net effect is that these connections you have will be started and stopped so often because you have different users on the site and making them persistent doesn't do any good.,0

65749,"there are a number of problems with the way in which you're attempting to insert the data, but i believe the reason that you're not having any output is because standard mysql commands are deprecated as of php 5.5, and removed as of php 7.0. instead, you should be using mysqli, or preferably, pdo. you'll need to restructure you code to use either, and i recommend reading up a bit on them first.",1
65750,"see http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.query.php and http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php for further instructions on how to use them. pdo is more secure, but harder to learn, and not all web hosts support it -- make sure to check with your hosting provider!",1
66196,isset is a boolean operator which returns true or false. you don't need to compare it to 1.,1
67763,an array needs to be printed out using a special function such as print_r. if you want to print out a value in your array try:,1

68746,"if just want the key, then you can use array_keys to get an array of keys.",1
69338,"by default pdo silently ignores errors and returns empty results. this could explain #2. for example, if your table is really called ""table"" and you didn't quote it with backticks (table is a reserved keyword). turn on error reporting to see if this is the case (see below).",1
69855,hint: stop using deprecated mysql_* api. use mysqli_* or pdo with prepared statements. mysql_*will be removed in the next version of php and prepared statements prevent you against sql injection.,1
70563,maybe you can compare the session variable with null may be it will be more clear.and don't forget to put your session_start(); before anything else on your page.,1

71604,"having said that, i would strongly suggest that you never allow the user to enter in parts of the actual sql you will run - unless it is a closed/secure environment, which means not an ope website.",1
72109,"on a side note, you should not use $_request['name'] but instead use $_post['name'] when the form method is post. it is more secure. and secondly, try to use mysqli database extension instead of using mysql. mysql extension is deprecated from php 5.5 onward.",1
72547,"don't use the mysql_* functions, as they are depreciated. i like pdo, so that's what i'm going to suggest to look into. (just google it, plenty is out there) this will also allow you to use prepared statements, which is one of the biggest things the mysql_* functions are missing.since you're using your post data multiple times, place them into local variables to start. it will make your code short, cleaner, easier to read, and if you ever change the name of a field, must easier to update in the future.place all errors into a single string. that way if it's successful, you only have to check one thing, and if it fails, you only have to send one thing back to the user.",1

90015,"pdostatement::execute() only returns a boolean indicating success or failure, so your variable $num is not what you want to fetch from.  by assigning the result to $num, you are not assigning the object $prep, but rather only the return value of the method call to execute() (true).",1
90122,but remember: cookies are saved local on the client pc. so the user can watch the cookie values. it would be the best you encrypt the cookie data so the user can't see the values in plain text.,1
90999,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
91193,"you always want to escape ` identifiers, even table names and field names, as maybe tomorrow they will be reserved words and break your query. as long as you are using prepared statements (pdo, mysqli, or whatever) you will be fine. note that pdo won't allow to escape table or field names.",1
91689,notephp mysql_* functions have been depricated since version 5.5.* and are going to be removed from the language soon. you should look into mysqli_* or pdo.,1
92774,"what you're looking for are $_session variables, which stay active until the user closes the browser or until the session expires (i think the default php config time is 24 minutes..?). this is a lot more efficient than storing them in a database for temporal purposes.",1

99027,"by the way please, don't use mysql_* functions in new code. they are no longer maintained and are officially deprecated. see the red box? learn about prepared statements instead, and use pdo or mysqli - this article will help you decide which. if you choose pdo, here is a good tutorial.",1
101151,"and consider using mysqli or pdo (and use parameterized queries), as mysql_* are deprecated!",1
102058,so i'm going to go ahead and suggest you make a major change to your code: don't use mysql_* functions as they are deprecated.,1
102167,"first thing first to make sure that empty values are not inserted, you need to check if that value is set from the form then execute the query when the value is set, also you need to prepare your statements when using pdo, also don't directly enter you variables in your query use placeholders instead.",1
103879,"another good habit is to check for errors after every call to pdo::prepare() or pdostatement::execute().  either enable exception mode, or else check the return values for false:",1
105660,"plus, i recommend you use mysqli_ functions with prepared statements, or pdo with prepared statements.",1
106188,"also, please note using pdo or mysqli for your requests. mysql is deprecated and can be vulnerable about sql injections.if you want to still on mysql and to don't use mysqli or pdo, you can use this mysql function to escape strings from the user to prevent sql injection:",1
106329,please update your code to use pdo. inserting into the database could be much easier and safer using prepared statements.,1

112664,"isset checks the variable to see if it has been set, in other words, it checks to see if the variable is any value except null or not assigned a value. isset returns true if the variable exists and has a value other than null. that means variables assigned a "" "", 0, ""0"", or false are set, and therefore are true for isset.",1

119605,array_diff returns elements in the first array that are not in the second so have $b before $a the arrays contain other arrays so you probably want to use array_column to get specifically the teacher_name column,1
120215,you have to call session_start() each time working with a session (not only when creating it),1

5937,"You'd think this act of blatant hypocrisy would make him decide to ease up on the sorcerers a bit from then on, but you'd be wrong...  Later on in series 3, there was a sorcerer going around healing people miraculously who was   Gaius's former lover .",1
5938,Uther wanted Gaius to see if sorcery was involved in the healings and it is implied he would have executed whoever did it.,1
5939,The fact that he was willing to use magic to miraculously heal Morgana is made even more hypocritical because of that in retrospect.,1
5940," /  Kill The Ones You Love  /  Shoot the Dog  Merlin poisons Morgana   who was unsware that she was the vessel of the Knights of Medhir   because  he did what he had to do  in order to save Camelot, but at the price of killing his friend and someone he cared about.",1

5951,"According to  Bradley James , the reason why they put a halt to  Arthur/Morgana  was to not get the impression of  Brother-Sister Incest  (since she is like his  sister-in-law ), and because they wanted to start the  Arthur/Gwen romance .",0
5952,"They then proceed to each stand up and give a speech about why they refuse to leave Arthur, one by one, until it reaches Merlin who remains seated and jokes, "" Actually I don't really fancy it.",0

5957,Gaius is also morally ambiguous (though by no means evil).,1

5960,Bradley James' (Arthur's) shirt collar becomes progressively more open with each episode.,0
5961,A good third of his (admittedly quite nice) chest is exposed.,0

5971,Gwen I'm that is not true.,0
5972,Then he died when Merlin finally met him.,1
5973,Morgana views   Uther keeping the secret that he is her real father  explicitly as this.,1
5974,"Plus, it's not like Arthur hates or even dislikes her, and like the prince would throw her out had he the chance.",1
5975,"In short, Morgana is literally living like a princess and she is set for a life as such, but she's ready to kill  her father  because he won't jeopardize his position (and hers, as been pointed in the  Succession Crisis  entry below ).",1
5976,"Yes, Uther is a hypocritical tyrant on many levels, but while his treatment of magical people or even of Morgana's ""father"" (Gorlois) are very slow in turning her against him, as soon as he declines recognising her as his daughter, she immediately tries to kill him.",1
5977,"Spoiled child's tantrum, much?",1
5978,Gaius is this towards Merlin.,0
5979, Morgana has a definite hand in finally killing Uther .,1
5980,"Actually, Gwen's physical appearance may just be one of the least anachronistic aspects of the show: her darker skin and curly hair suggest that she is  Silurian  (no, not  that  kind of Silurian).",0

6006,Merlin assumes the spirit wants revenge against the deceased Uther and is targeting Arthur instead.,0
6007,Although Arthur doesn't know it.,0
6008,It comes true in 3.12 when she temporarily overthrows Uther and appoints herself queen.,1
6009,"It's ironic because   both Morgause, Morgana and it appears Agravaine as well seem to be under the impression that an unacknowledged, unmarried bastard daughter could actually take the throne legitimately.",1
6010,"Morgana also seems a bit pissed that Uther never acknowledged her, not seeming to realise that declaring her his bastard child would take her massively far down in status as opposed to making her a princess.",1
6011,"Morgause and Morgana simpy plan to kill Arthur, because they think that, with only one child left, Uther would ""no"" choice but no make Morgana his crowned heir: after all, we are shown that it's not a simple matter of lineage, as Arthar has to be made official heir, that ""legitimacy"" is taken away later in the two-parter episode and Catrina becomes in turn the designated heir; in addition, Uther reminds Arthur that he personally had to win his kingdom, not inherit it, and thus puts Arthur though quite a few ordeals and trials to judge if his son is ready to become king.",1
6012,"On the other hand and for added  Fridge Logic , if Arthur died and Uther made Morgana his heir, the king would probably not even need to officially recognise her as his daughter, as the fact she's been his ward for half her life, that she's had first row seat to how to rule a kingdom, and that he dearly loved her would easily explain it to the whole kingdom.",1
6013,"So, really, the whole ""she's actually his daughter"" is not really useful in terms of usurping the throne; it's far more useful to show Uther as an hypocrite, Morgana's sliding deeper into evil, and complicating the whole Morgana issue for Arthur.",1
6014,Percival appears to have this.,0
6015,This is revealed to be a  subversion  later in the series when we learn  that Morgana is actually Uther's biological daughter .,1

6323,"Also, unlike most uses of this trope, it wasn't  Played for Laughs .",1
6324,"It is heavily implied that, although Trudy's murder via a bombing didn't cause Monk's issues, but it certainly made it a lot worse than before, suffering a mental breakdown that forced him into early retirement from the force before the start of the series, and necessitated therapy as well as  finding Trudy's killer, not to mention learning that the car bomb was intended for Trudy all along and not a backfired assassination attempt on him  that he ever gets better.",1
6325,"He also has relatively minor episodes within the main  Heroic BSOD , namely pertained to whether he can get his old job back or not (such as when he was not only removed from the case, but also had his detective's license revoked by the commissioner simply because he accidentially deleted a few years worth of forensic files while attempting to eliminate crumbs from the keyboard, or when a four-year hiring freeze threatened his chances of reinstatement).",1
6326,"A prior instance of this is where he has a cold case about a valedictorian student being killed by a drunk driver, and this combined with Monk's greater skill as a detective, left him frequently depressed.",0

6341,Monk himself often is in this trope:   In  Mr.,1
6342,"Monk Goes to the Dentist , he has a crippling fear of dentists due to a bad experience, a fear so severe, in fact, that he was completely unwilling to go beyond the waiting room while Disher and Natalie investigate a murder that seemingly happened while Disher was getting his appointment regarding a seeming kidnapping of ""Barry Bonds,"" and later had to be pried off when he was literally frozen in fear in his seat during the wait (presumably from hearing a drill whirring in the background).",1
6343,"Turns out he was very much justified in this fear, as he ends up being abducted and then tortured by the same dentists in regards to potential clients for the bearer bonds and whether the police had them monitored (an incident that also resulted in his fear of them being heightened as a result to the extent that he refuses to go to a dentist even after one of his teeth was chipped).",1

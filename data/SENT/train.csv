4,"in this case, the encoding of the data on the wire is not json .",0
7,php decodes the url-encoded post body automatically.,0
11,you don't necessarily have to use get method to retain the sort order.,0
12,you can also use the cookie to store the sort order.in that way your code will look more cleaner.,0
14,"and when the page loads for the first time or refreshes, call the same sort function and call getcookie() to get the cookie value and set that as your sort order before sorting.",0
15,"if you want to use get, this will also do the work when page refreshes , i hope you call this function tablesort() when document is ready.",0
16,you can either do a strtotime function or do an explode and do a mktime of the exploded elements.,0
17,"as was mentioned in a reply, you will want to santize the variables when printing them out, and maybe protect it going in (more than an addslashes)",0
21,"along with this cookie, you must create a row in a table ( sessions ) within your database with the value of the hash , and the corresponding logged in user id.",0
23,"assuming it finds one, grab the user id that matches with the corresponding value, and log that specific user in.",0
24,"same thing goes for when the user logs out; delete the hash from the client-side and the database table, every time (for security purposes).",0

27,the definitive guide to form-based website authentication what is the best way to implement “remember me” for a website?,0
34,you don't need to use match everywhere.,0
36,right after select is where you choose which columns from those rows are displayed.,0
37,order by determines which column and direction the rows are sorted by.,0
39,you're right that sessions cannot be shared in this way.,0
41,make sure the domain parameter when you set the cookie is something like,0
42,then you'll be able to access the cookie from any subdomain of mysite.org,0
44,"regardless of the value of $count at this point, your script will send a location header.",0
45,"in other words, the browser is receiving a redirect either way, whether $count is equal to 1 or not.",0
46,"in combination with this line, your loop is defined.",0
47,"this evaluates to true if the user has these cookies defined, which happens when they are logging in for the first time, or have already logged in.",0
48,"if they are logged in, their username and password must be valid, and $count will end up as 1, because they are in the database.",0
50,this is the essence of your problem.,0
52,"you already have three cookies: username , password , and typeofuser .",0
53,"the system you have works fine, but most authentication scripts use sessions, accessible like cookies ($_cookie['foo']), but with the $_session variable instead.",0
54,"the advantage to using session is that the values you store in them are not available to anyone but scripts on your server/site, to view, or to edit.",0
55,"in general, the less information you expose to the user, the better.",0
56,"if you need clarification, check out this stackoverflow post or the basic examples on the php website .",0
57,"one more thing to point out is in your script, if(isset($_cookie[""username""])&amp;&amp;isset($_cookie[""password""])){ has no else statement.",0
58,"if one or both of these cookies are not defined, no code will be executed, and what i am assuming is a protected page will be displayed publicly.",0
59,"you may want to add an else statement, something along the lines of:",0
60,"two problems, one closing ) and a missing semicolon after str_replace, also you should know your str_replace won't do anything in your code so i added $text = ... :)",0

82,if you want to prevent counting all the pages just use arrays and array_search,0
83,"databases are fast, maybe they are not as fast as basic string operations in php, but if there is a lot of data, databases will probably be faster.",0
84,"a basic select query takes (on my current default desktop hardware) about 15ms, cached less than 1ms, and this is pretty much independend of the number of names in your table, if the indexes are correct.",0
85,so your site will always be fast.,0
86,"databases won't cause a stackoverflow or an out of memory error and crash your site (this is very depending on your php-settings and hardware) databases are more flexible, imagine you want to add / remove / edit names after creating the first data-set.",0
88,"you definitly need to use mysqli or pdo instead, code maybe like this:",0
90,i would print_r sessions to see what got registered.,0
91,why do you have issues with default session path?,0
92,i wouldn't try to alter it and make sure that works first.,0
93,this is altering the main functionality of hybridauth.,0
94,if you have shell access make sure the web server user has write access to the directory; that should take care of the issue.,0
96,you can't actually stick to your two helper methods - sometimes you need to use raw pdo instance.,0
97,"nobody asks you everytime open a connection, perform 3 lines of code and close it.",0
98,even with raw pdo connection is opened only once.,0
100,"they needed in constructor only and nowhere else why not to create a connection right in the constructor, without the need for extra method?",0
101,public function getone() would be indispensable addition to your set.,0
102,you need to make $connection public - at least until you make all the methods available from both pdo and pdostatement,0
103,there are some possible benefits of doing something like this.,0
104,"for example, you can embed query profiling and application logging into the class.",0
105,"and, as you point out, you have the option of structuring the queries in a way thats easiest for you to work with and maintain.",0
106,"on the other hand, the code will be less portable if it relies on your wrapper class.",0
108,"you might get around some of those limitations by extending the pdo class, rather than creating a wrapper for it.",0
109,must have a name attribute in order to return a value.,0
110,"secondly, you are accessing the $_post superglobal even when viewing the page normally i.e.",0

114,"instead, you can do this way:",0
115,"i don't know if this is the problem, i always use prepare and execute .",0
116,it could just be for performance reasons.,0

121,this is my code to save the result of a select query into a text file as insert statement.i first extend the pdostatement class to add the custom method saveresultasinsertstatement :,0
122,then i extend the pdo class to set the attribute pdo::attr_statement_class,0
124,just apply that to $_session['id'] and so on and the errors will stop.,0
125,"in your first run, $_session['id'] and $_session['rememberme'] won't be set.you have to check if they're set (just as you did with your cookie)",0
126,you need to also make sure you know what id was submitted:,0
127,"of course, you're wide open to attacks like this as everyone else is saying.",0
129,also make sure your database connection is also in utf-8 charset.,0
130,"your collecations in database/fields should also be set to utf-8, however if they are not this would probably not cause this sort of error.",0
131,"this is bit of hacky, but will solve your issue.",0

149,you might like to confirm the action was successful.,0
150,"so isn't here for people to write your code, you need to dig into this.",0
152,feel free to ask further questions if you hit problems with programming.,0
154,there are several errors in your code.,0
155,"besides that ""ton\ino\"" is not a valid string and [^&lt;&gt;?=/\]+ is not a valid regular expression, you have probably some logical misunderstanding.",0
156,"your regular expression [^&lt;&gt;?=/\\]+ (here corrected) will match if there is at least one character that is not &lt; , &gt; , ?",0
158,"so if there is at least one such character, preg_match returns 1 .",0
159,"ton\ino"" and ton?asd=3 do both contain at least one such character (the match is in both cases ton ).",0
160,a fix for this is to either use assertions for the start and end of the string ( ^ and $ ) to only allow legal characters for the whole string:,0
161,or to use a positive character class [&lt;&gt;?=/\\]+ to match the illegal characters and negate the returned expression of preg_match :,0
162,but it would be certainly better to use a whitelist instead of a blacklist.,0
164,please check this answer hope it will helps you.,0
167,"you should use ""==="" and it's good to trip line-ending symbols.",0
169,you should check all logins and exit only if none of them matches.,0
171,"next problem as i can see is that strpos is not good function to check if name exist as it's enough if entered string is only part of full string.for exapmle if i'm an evil student and entered (for example) just ""e"".",0
173,the issue is that you are selecting from the database users where they have admin access already ie,0
174,the correct way to access the table data will be using either,0
175,"so, this ""works"" the same way that hammering a screw in does.",0
176,"it will get in there, but not really the way you want to do things.",0
178,"your page will trigger, but it is the wrong tool to get the job done.",0
180,it will try to fetch the contents of addtofavorites.php but it will expect javascript as the return.,0
181,and you won't be able to use $_post since you have no way to post data to the request.,0
182,"if you are already using a javascript library, then it will have a nice ajax wrapper for you (i don't know of a single library off the top of my head that doesn't).",0
184,"as an example, i will use jquery, because it is one of the most popular ones.",0
187,and the 3rd line is missing an opening bracket { though i'm not sure if that is just an artifact of your copy paste or not.,0
189,the events api for jquery will let you listen for events on objects.,0
190,"if your mysql database is on the same server as your php script, then the usual logical approach is that your host is localhost .",0
191,the same as you used on your local computer -- because they're on the same machine.,0
192,"however, if your mysql database is on another server seperate from your php scripts the you will need to access that server using a web address for your php to connect to yout mysql.",0
194,"i believe it would be more usual for mysql and php to be on the same disk, especially for non-professional systems as your appears to be, so then the issue would be:",0
206,"references to $_files['file'] should have been $_files['userfile'] (this may be specific to your server, i'm not sure, but you initially use $_files['userfile'] ) $newfilename needed the $file_ext added to it added a check for move_uploaded_file() success changed $_request superglobal to $_post (you should not use $_request unless you have to) i took into account @lars' answer",0
207,"if you would like to see the code behind, use the following link:",0
208,"you must use the second parameter to true in your case, because you are handling the decoded json as an associative array rather than a php object.",0
210,"by assigning the result to $num , you are not assigning the object $prep , but rather only the return value of the method call to execute() ( true ).",0
211,"beyond that, your sql should execute correctly and the one column it returns should contain the count you need.",0
212,"in this case (especially since you are calling fetchcolumn() with no argument) it doesn't matter, but for future readers, it is advisable to name the count() aggregate with an alias that can then be used in an associative or object fetch:",0
214,"however, as the error message says, you cannot pass a boolean (instead of an array) to in_array , yet you set the value to false in order to skip it?",0
215,"instead of using false in your ternary operator, use an empty array array() instead, since its empty, the value will not exist in it, and the condition will skip as expected, and it will be the correct data type.",0
216,"if you really must use false in that variable, you need to check if its false first, something like this:",0
217,"i think you are mixing up where to use single and double quotes..generally, for arrays/objects like $row, you get the value from the array with either no quotes, or single quotes, echo $row['klass']",0
218,"if you want to copy over every individual field from $_post to $_session , you could use something like this:",0
219,"for one thing, sql injections and html injections can (should) be protected in another way.",0
222,working with them will be a hell later.,0
223,"other than these two injection attacks, what will your method do?",0
224,"well, it can do some regexps for stuff like numbers, phone numbers, emails, names and dates.",0
225,unfortunately that's just a part of all the validations you will have to do.,0
226,"other common cases that you cannot validate there are cross-checking of inputs (start date before end date), and checking that a value is in a list of allowed predefined values (say, for a &lt;select&gt; element).",0
227,and there are an infinite number of custom validation steps that you will have in your application as well.,0
228,"is it worth to split up all validation in ""generic type validation"" and ""custom rule validation""?",0
229,or perhaps this will just make a bigger mess.,0
230,remove the action and the method from the form.,0
231,use client-side ajax for the request.,0
232,note : you need to start session at top of file users.php as well.,0
233,"here, you're evaluating an expression fine (although you really should use &amp;&amp; , not and ) and executing a sql query right, but you need to loop through the results of $query , you can't just set $_session['user'] = mysql_fetch_assoc($query); .",0
234,"if you're having trouble validating whether people are submitting nothing for username and password, add this if statement to the top of your script:",0
235,"there's nothing wrong with that code, but i'm not sure what its function is.",0
240,"and your login.php ( if you use prepared statement and if the code is fixed, it would look like this ):",0
241,$student_name is undefined in your code to check the number of rows affected by the last sql statement we use rowcount(),0
242,if both fields empty then you write check for individual fields.if both fields empty then it will goes inside that condition.,0
244,"you still need to check $result to ensure query was successful, as well as $row to ensure there's entry for that user to get password's salf from, but i intentionally left it as your homework :)",0
245,"i think you have it covered, just a simple change, remove the single quotes in the sql from around the sort and order variables",0
247,no if/else spaghetti easy to add more options in the future no need for mysql_real_escape_string due to pdo prepared statements checks that only allowed variables are accepted from $_post,0
249,"it will stay there, however if you unset the object and your script pushes php to the memory limits the objects not needed will be garbage collected.",0
250,i would go with unset() (as opposed to setting it to null) as it seams to have better performance (not tested but documented on one of the comments from the php official manual).,0
251,that said do keep in mind that php always destroys the objects as soon as the page is served.,0
252,so this should only be needed on really long loops and/or heavy intensive pages.,0
253,it is safer to use first one because you do more checks.,0
254,"most of the time you can find the ip in remote_addr or http_x_forwarded_for if it's going throw proxy, but sometimes you can have in other variables because there is no standard for this.",0
255,"personally i usually go with second approach because it's more clean, but if you want to make sure you have the ip use the first one.",0
256,also you don't need to use getenv() .,0
258,i think you have declared the url in wrong way check the below code,0
259,"or if array_column is available, you could use it too:",0
261,"then when they successfully log in, you can do this:",0
263,start up a php session for the logged in user carry the users id across the mini application so that it can later be inserted in another form and into the database without the user having to type it in themselves,0
269,you might want to also take a look at this related question php user authentication with sessions,0
271,you then build dates internally in your code in y-m-d format.,0
272,that means your in_array() call is literally trying to do,0
273,you are misunderstanding how in_array works.,0
274,you want to check the keys.,0
276,"if you want to show the exact message as fetched from the database, use &lt;pre&gt; tag!",0
280,you tenating string from user input.,0
281,it is vunerable to sql injection.,0
283,what are advantages of this approach?,0
284,you have all your roles listed in one table and because of foreign key you will preserve data integrity.,0
285,in column role of user table you will be able to store only role which is also stored in role table.,0
286,if you would try to remove role which is assigned still assigned to any user database wouldn't allow it.,0
287,this answer assumes your user could have only one role.,0
288,"if you want to be able to assing multiple roles to your user, you would have to learn how to map many-to-many relationship in database.",0
291,echo $email_address = $_post['email']; you are using this value in your function.,0
292,"in if condition you are using $_post['contact_email'] , please note : one is email and other is contact_email",0
293,"you're checking to see if $_post['contact_email'] is empty but passing the value of $_post['email'] to $email_address , i'm assuming that contact_email is the one you want since that is the one you're checking to see if its empty or not.",0
294,so email will either be empty or something@something none of which is a valid email.,0
295,"you have to add the comma to the date format and then use only first part of exploded array, so part of code is:",0
296,"moreover you don't need this row, is useless.",0
297,delete it and use only variable $t.,0
299,means db code will never know which variable intended to be int and which is not.,0
300,"see - there is no trace nor of pdo, nor of sql.",0
302,and obviously this db layer should be able to handle data properly regardless any prior validations.,0
303,"which makes the latter just useless, if they done only for db.",0
304,"frankly, it's db layer's business, how to format values, not programmer's",0
306,if you have your values already in array why bother with inserting variables directly at all?,0
307,you are apparently doing multiple inserts.,0
308,"with placeholders for all values you can prepare your query once and then only execute it with new portions of data - so, actually use this neat side effect of prepared statements:",0
309,the first is that you're setting the value of $x to be the value in the key-value pair.,0
310,then you're unsetting a key that doesn't exist.,0
311,"the value of $x is then changed to ""eins"" in the line $x=$arr[$x].",0
312,"then you try to unset $x (which is invalid because you don't have an array entry with the key ""eins""",0
314,"the result of this is the array called translate array being an array with elements(""eins"",""drei"");",0
315,"so, you can fix this problem just by adding single quotes",0
316,"however, there is much bigger problem in this code.",0
318,"just think what would happen if your password contains a single quote, such as test'123:",0
319,"in ajax you should use $val = $_post[""soc""] .",0
321,you will just want to have the in the file you are linking too $projectid = $_get['projectid'];,0
322,"all the other answers suggest explode and splitting lines, this is generally really slow.",0
323,you should use strpos and loop through the results.,0
324,then you can store the $json string to your member table.,0
325,"when you want to fetch it from the database later, you have to json_decode it and put the function result in $_session['cart'] again.",0
326,"as you see, i have put your $cart variable into the $_session .",0
328,this will reduce load on the database as well as speed up your script.,0
330,to add a new product or to increase the quantity of an existing position simply do this:,0
331,"you can also use empty($var) function, to test for empty values, just pay attention that empty will return true for values like :",0
332,"isset($var) returns true if the variable is defined, regardless of the value (except null ).",0
333,"in your case, it is defined but contains an empty string.",0
334,you'd want to use empty($var) which does not throw an exception if the variable is not defined and tests for actual content.,0
335,a lot of people here are saying the value of a $_get['para1'] is null but that is not the case.,0
336,there is a comment on the php.net $_get docs that provides a useful script to test this.,0
337,"even though it does not appear para1 has a value set, it actually does.",0
338,"the value is an empty string ( """" ).",0
339,"even though this value is falsy, it is still a value and as such, isset() returns true.",0
340,you can use !empty() to return false on empty strings.,0
341,see a comparison of isset() empty() and is_null() here .,0
342,"the value exists in the $_get array but his value is null,the function isset only evaluate if the value is initialized, not if the value is truthy.",0
343,"if you want to know if the value is truthy, you can compare the array index with the == operator, like this var_dump($_get['para1'] == true)",0
345,"if you explode the string with explode($delimiter, $string, [$limit]) , being in the case you had as an example ""times"" as the $delimiter, you can get an array with 5 and 8 as values.",0
346,sorry if i'm a little bit off base; i'm trying to understand how the variables are being used (as their initialization is not shown).,0
347,so $this->unreadthreadslist is an array where the indices (if value set to 1).,0
348,"looking at what you're doing, here is an idea i had.",0
349,it does the same thing but just does some extra checking on $this->unreadthreadslist and it accesses the variable directly.,0
350,"for the result of ""fetchthreadssincedata($since)"" and an array structure of",0
351,for the $this->unreadthreadslist where the first index is the board and the second index is the thread id.,0
352,"as mentioned by kenb, we need to see the php code that you are using to process the form input.",0
353,"if you are doing that in your code, don't .",0
354,this is not the proper way to process form input.,0
357,read about 'disabling magic quotes' .,0
358,"if you have no control over the code that is adding the slashes, then you can remove them with a simple php function called stripslashes .",0
359,what you want is to replace a literal \\n with a literal \n .,0
360,note that to specify a literal backslash it must be doubled; hence the triple backslash you see below.,0
361,...it could have been written differently.,0
362,"the following code is easier to read, saves you having to escape the literal "" , and doesn't require php to interpret the string.",0
363,"i've given the above code as examples to explain how php interprets escapes sequences, but don't use them.",0
364,"either avoid adding the slashes in the first place or strip them using the proper function, as explained in the first part of this answer.",0
367,"but to remove it after the fact, you could try the following",0
368,"of course, then you'd likely need to correct other c++ end-of-line sequences.",0
369,so it is better to not add it in the first place.,0
370,"the form of the array is up to you, but 2 main ways are possible.",0
372,that way repeated links just overwrite themselves.,0
373,"2) if you don't like that, and you know that the urls will be identical, use array_unique($links) to process the array you get from json_decode()",0
374,you could also save the $files variable in the $_session array.,0
375,then check the size of the $files and create links based on the size you want.,0
376,"you will still have to use th bind_result after that, and forget about fetch_assoc .",0
377,a mysqli_stmt only has a fetch method:,0
378,"also, for consistency, change mysqli_connection_error() to if ($mysqli-&gt;connect_error) or something.",0
380,"according to the docs, you can't use this, as yourcommonsense pointed out to me, because it was broken until php 5.2.9 and 5.3.0. it's recommended to keep the procedural check to ensure compatibility.",0
381,what happens if you use the htmlentities(); method?,0
382,give the following code a try:,0
383,"this is probably because those special characters, (in this one, the a with the roof ) aren't printed correctly when you print them as plain text.",0
385,the method used bellow does this automatically.,0
386,"a very basic way is that you can declare a variable (for example $pattern )and store regular expressions (like patterns used commonly in attacks) in it, then use preg_match($pattern, $valuefromyourform) method to see if any of the passed values matches any of those expressions and then you can stop the execution.",0
387,"you have to first get all the order id(s), then you have to loop it to get the desired total, or tax or discount.",0
390,you are using mysqli_connect and querying the table with mysql_query .,0
392,your form looks ok and the uploads work for me just fine.,0
393,make sure you have enabled error reporting and that you have uploads enabled in your php.ini,0
394,when u use variables you can need to keep the quotes away so the second is the right one.,0
395,you dont need to use explode anymore cause you already have an array.,0
396,in your example it would be:,0
397,i understand you want to explode the response variable and assign each value to the corresponding variable.,0
398,you can achieve it this way instead of using list:,0
400,"other problem is about the structure, you can't add a &lt;p&gt; element into the &lt;table&gt; .",0
403,"note: in the sql, i selected only the field that your code requested.",0
404,first create a string of all the ids and use in(string of ids) in your query and store all the data corresponding to id in an array.,0
406,"you are posting a comma separated list (i'd post an array but what the hell), so we're going to simply parse the string into integers and stick it in mysql's in clause",0
407,"note: i didn't test the code so don't copy paste it, it most likely contains errors.",0
410,so you should encode dangerous characters with htmlspecialchars :,0
412,but with common charsets such as utf-8 and most single byte ansi charsets this is not required),0
415,"another variant is to use unsecure $model-&gt;setattributes($_post[contentform], false) where false tells yii to set all attributes, not only that are considered safe.",0
416,"also, you don't need three redirects.",0
417,this is http redirect to other page.,0
418,"this time, you just should just specify route to model view action and its parameter that is id, for example.",0
419,i hope this time i get what you want.,0
420,"consider each line is a subarray, each book name is an index, you can use preg_match to split by 2 or more space, the first item of the returned array is the book name (the index), the other is the values in the subarray.",0
421,"that is, you can write something like this:",0
422,"and, remember that the code above is not written to be used in real life.",0
423,"add error checking everywhere you can, never assume that the input file is always valid (as i had assumed in the code above).",0
424,"maybe on some lines there are 8, 9, or more items, and on other ones there are only 6, 5 or less items.",0
425,in these case the code above will malfunction.,0
428,"you must get the id immediately following the insert statement that generated it, in the same session.",0
431,"you'll need to restructure you code to use either, and i recommend reading up a bit on them first.",0
432,see http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.query.php and http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php for further instructions on how to use them.,0
434,one thing both methods push heavily is prepared queries.,0
437,if you are selling only in the states as your question update is confirming:,0
439,if you are using a windows server and you absolutely must use an access database back-end (which is strongly discouraged ) i would recommend that you use ado under com_dotnet like this:,0
440,now as you said you've tried explode function then its been used on string and not an array.,0
441,what you can try over here is you can use array_column if php version &gt;= 5.5 like as,0
442,or for lower version you can simply use array_map like as,0
443,you should be getting a fatal error: can't use function return value in write context ... but you probably did something wrong with turning on error reporting and you're not getting any errors.,0
445,"try $_server['http_host'] instead, it is set always as long as you force http 1.1",0
446,"use ""and"" if you need all of conditions, not ""or""",0
447,you shouldn't use $_server['php_self'] in that way.,0
448,then php_self print the complete url to your page.,0
451,in your case its enough to use only ?page or write the complete url before the parameters.,0
452,$_cookie is populated with the data sent from the browser to the server.,0
454,simply use jquery and replace your php code with this :,0
456,"warning: mysql_ finctions are deprecated as of php 5.5.0, and will be removed in the future.",0
459,if the query was unsuccessful mysql_query returns false.,0
460,try specifying the / path when you use the setcookie() function.,0
461,"you should just put it into csv format, and make the first token the key and the second token the value.",0
465,this is the code you might be looking for:,0
466,"now check this $_session[""loggedin""]=""success"" on all your other pages to check whether the user is genuine.",0
467,"that way you tell phpstorm, that the following variable (property) is of type pdo .",0
468,"note that private here depends on your code, this is here just an example.",0
469,take a look at this to learn more about php documentation comments in phpstorm.,0
470,it seem's that's not the only thing you have to add in your source :,0
472,the &amp; is a special character in html which is used to escape special characters (for example to print &lt; in a html page you'd have to write &amp;lt;.,0
473,it also has a special meaning in urls as a separator for request variables (e.g.,0
475,the correct way to write an &amp; within html is &amp;amp;.,0
478,no it is not possible in php to add functionality to existing native classes.,0
479,"unset() has nothing to do with autoloading, and will not interfer with it.",0
481,running the following demonstrates that unset should work ok with autoload.the test class didn't use __contruct().so it looks like something in marketplacewebservice_client mws is upsetting the apple cart.,0
482,"first, you need to add a name attribute to the input box, as such:",0
483,"second, you are setting the value of $username before anything has been posted.",0
485,not until after you submit the form will it have a value.,0
486,"so, you need to check if the form has been submitted first:",0
487,here is a complete and working version of your program:,0
489,"if this is so, then you can just run the function immediately and it will pick up the values currently on the page.",0
490,you can do this with trigger('change') or the shorthand form change() :,0
492,most probably you include some other things (elements) from the post in your *.jpg data.,0
493,"make sure you include only raw and valid *.jpg picture information, not other elements.",0
494,"also keep in mind that $http_raw_post_data is not available with form's type enctype=""multipart/form-data"" .",0
498,"if you want to add the ampersand, you can use array_pop($array) which will remove the last element.",0
499,just check that the array is at least 3 in length.,0
502,"you should also have some code that looks similar to this, i would imagine, to get it to work correctly:",0
504,that should print your values to the screen.,0
505,"it seems that i'm not actually answering what you were originally wanting to do, though.",0
506,"if you're wanting to apply a function to every element of an array, i would suggest that you look at array_map .",0
507,you can use array_map like this:,0
508,"ultimately, if the recursion is something that you desire, you could probably do something like this:",0
509,"if you problem is that you have trouble finding out which checkboxes have been checked, and which one have not, here are two solutions :",0
511,the variable $checked will be true if the user checked the checkbox check1 .,0
512,"(beware, it does not mean that its value is value1 )",0
513,"you can also add a hidden field named just like your checkbox, that will act as a default value :",0
516,"array_pluck works with an array of arrays, an array of objects, or even a laravel collection (like the results of a database query).",0
517,"in the end, your code can probably boil down to something like:",0
519,"since the second condition seems to be always the same, you could simply put the switch in the if of the second condition or use the clause inside each case but this would be redundant code.",0
520,"there's your problem - you're trying to do two sql statements with one call, and mysql_query won't let you do that.",0
526,"it's not clear how much of the above you currently have as you only give one or two line snippets here and there, but this should give a good outline of what you need to do.",0
527,"add $database-&gt;setattribute(pdo::attr_errmode, pdo::errmode_exception); right after the connection is opened, including, and at the top of your file(s):",0
529,change to mysqli or pdo and make sure your safely escaped!,0
530,"in order to make it work, you must add $conn = database::getinstance() into your selectguildinfo (assuming $conn from your working example is instance of database).",0
532,"here is a way to use the laravel query builder for making the query, but to then use the underlying pdo fetch to loop over the record set which i believe will solve your problem - running one query and looping the record set so you don't run out of memory on 30k records.",0
535,"you are messing up with single quotes and double quotes and missing them in many places.also, as i already pointed out in the comments, it is hard to debug by guessing.",0
536,you should echo the mysql error you get when running the query.,0
537,what you echo by now is that the after running the query you don't get an array of results: but this is caused by the query to have an issue.,0
539,finally: you can get this also because you don't have any error but you are just retrieving an empty set of results from the query (no record satisfy your query)change this query to this:,0
541,also consider moving to pdo instead of mysqli.,0
542,"upon failure, mysqli_query will return false rather than a mysqli_result and, if you then attempt to use that boolean false value in something like mysqli_num_rows , that's exactly the error you'll see.",0
543,"as a first point, you should always check the return value of functions that can fail, that's just good practice.",0
545,"having said that, you then have to move on to why the query has failed.",0
546,a large proportion of sql problems become obvious if you just print out the query before trying to execute it.,0
547,it looks like you've eventually done this since one of your comments states that your query is:,0
548,"this is not a valid sql statement, hence the problem.",0
549,"now, despite the fact it appears to be using a different table name (an earlier edit of your question did have a matching table name), it corresponds closely to your $sql3 variable 1 :",0
550,"that's where you need to concentrate your effort, to find out exactly why they aren't set.",0
551,"for a start, it seems rather unwise to be using $row[anything] after the loop processing the rows has finished.",0
552,"it may well be that you need to move that code to within the loop to get it working but, without more information and context, that's really just conjecture (though educated conjecture).",0
554,"in this particular case , i would recommend , using $_request in place of all post and get.",0
555,"so your query gets all params , and your code goes perfect.",0
570,so if your color.choices file has these options below.,0
571,"then your array will start at 0,1,2 as i used above for your colors e.g.",0
573,$content[1] would be the shape line.,0
574,and then you would still have to explode them into a new var.,0
575,what i would do is make it an ini file.,0
576,you are already using the file in the form of an ini so why not make it easier to work with the values?,0
577,using an ini file is better because then you can use the key name without having to know what order they are in the file.,0
578,"once parsed, it's already in the form of an array so you can just call $attr[""color""] or $attr[""shape""] etc and it doesn't matter what order they are in the color_choice.ini file.",0
580,notice also the form variable changes as well for $color .,0
581,"old question but you can get the get variables the same way before with $_get, but you have to still match the route.",0
582,"i.e., if the route isn't matched your script doesn't proceed.",0
583,would be (you can use just get or post if you like) :,0
584,after you can do &lt;?php echo $_get['redirect'] ?&gt; and get:,0
585,"that's a very good question, but there is one wrong premise at the very beginning: you are taking error reporting for pdo separated from site-wide error reporting.",0
586,"which makes very little sense: pdo errors in every way are the same as other errors - filesystem errors, http errors, and so on.",0
587,"thus, there is no reason in establishing pdo-only error reporting.",0
590,"thus, here is not a single reason in setting error_reporting to disastrous level of 0.",0
591,to answer the rest of your questions all you need is a little common sense.,0
592,a custom error screen is a very different matter and your code is especially bad with it.,0
593,neither it should be a 404 error nor an http redirect have to be used (thats very bad for seo).,0
594,to create a custom error page you have to use either your web-server features (preferred) or an error handler in php script.,0
596,and every web-server can catch this status and show an according error page.,0
598,you want to use a get variable.,0
600,"as magnus eriksson noted in the comments, you can negate this by either typecasting $_get['id'] to the int type, or by using prepared statements:",0
602,so $_post['monday'] is just an array of all the checked boxes.,0
604,"when you add a new row, you need to increment the index.",0
605,"in the php, you then need to check whether the parameter is set.",0
606,well a php return won't actually return to the jquery.,0
608,what you should do is return a json object with true or false by printing that to the page.,0
609,then the jquery can look for that and react.,0
610,you only run urldecode over data is url encoded.,0
611,"php will have decoded it before populating $_post , so you certainly shouldn't be using that.",0
612,"(you might have to if you are dealing with double-encoded data, but the right solution there should be to not double encode the data).",0
614,it is useful if you have a free form input in which rogue spaces might be typed.,0
615,you will need to do further sanity checking afterwards.,0
616,and as amal already said update your code to pdo or mysqli,0
617,"""back in the day, many many moons ago, wordpress blindly followed php in accepting that all of the superglobal values should be slashed.php later did a reversal on the idea to something more sane which you see today, but the damage was done, wordpress as an application had existed for long enough, and there were enough existing plugins and themes relying upon wordpress creating a sane single environment that wordpress also changing would cause irreparable damage to those sites - introduce security vulnerabilities, mangle content, and a bunch of other fun things.",0
618,"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18322 is our ticket for tracking this and getting to something more sane - in the shortterm (and longer term) we'd request that if you're accessing $_post variables you do it as such: $myvar = wp_unslash( $_post['variable'] ); so that one day, we'll be able to have $_post as an unslashed array.",0
621,if you read the $mysqli->escape_string description you will learn that his function has nothing to do with security risks.,0
622,neither trim is security related stripslashes makes no sense at all and may rathe spoil your data than do anything useful doing strip_tags and htmlspecialchars at the same time makes no sense.,0
623,choose one if you skip strip_tags but keep htmlspecialchars when trying to display html you'll be surprised,0
624,"if your ultimate goal is to prevent security risks and adopt best practices, then definitly you should have a look to php data objects (pdo) .",0
625,there are multiple advantages when using pdo.,0
626,"first you do not need to escape your parameters or your full sql query because, with pdo, you will be using prepared statements.",0
627,if that's not what you want you need to enclose what you want done first in () e.g.,0
631,add global $targetmessage; at the beginning of both functions.,0
632,take care of side-effects: that variable will be also accessible from everywhere else.,0
633,"you should actually use a parameter instead of a global variable: function func_readmsg($targetmessage) and function func_delmsg($targetmessage) , then pass the value of $targetmessage as a parameter when you call the functions.",0
640,there is a good example on that page that i think shows what you need.,0
641,i'll try to provide a better example using your data.,0
642,suppose after looping through your albums you end up with an array $myalbums that looks like this:,0
643,"in order to sort this by date, you could do the following (taken from the example on the php page)",0
645,you might have to change the sort_desc flag depending on what formate your dates are in.,0
646,"i can't really explain how this works, because i'm still trying to figure it out myself... but i think it is what you need.",0
649,"also, each radio button must have the same name (if you want to user to be able to check only one of them).",0
650,you could use raii or a factory class+reference counting to manage the statements.,0
651,that way you don't need to explicitly check when it's time to close anything.,0
652,"without seeing the details of how you're using your wrapper, it's hard to go into detail.",0
653,"objective-c's accessor pattern may also be of use, which would look something like:",0
655,to solve this follow the below things :,0
656,you are mixing pdo and mysql extension.,0
658,"and your open to sql injection for usernames that are actually sql query's, or at minimum a username with a ' in it will break your query.",0
660,they are no longer maintained and are officially deprecated .,0
661,"learn about prepared statements instead, and use pdo or mysqli - this article will help you decide which.",0
662,"if you choose pdo, here is a good tutorial .",0
663,"one caveat of this approach is if any of the ten node items are missing, it waits for next corresponding item to complete its 10 batch set, and hence misaligning rows (e.g., 115ok, 115iok, 116fr, 115value).",0
665,what is the ';' at the end of your statement?,0
666,you are giving mysqli an invalid query and so it is not creating an object for you.,0
667,"the problem is not the fetch_object, but the prepare statement.remove the ';' and try again.",0
670,it will then show up under $_post['submit'],0
671,echo $_post['submit_btn']; will give you the value of which submit button is clicked,0
675,"if the test for isset($_post['submit']) is failing it either means that the submit param is not provided, or it's present with a null value.",0
676,"this is a hazard of using isset rather than a more accurate check like array_key_exists('submit', $_post) .",0
677,also why check for the presence of that param so late?,0
680,":) is a non-capturing subpattern, which doesn't mean that anything in the result doesn't get returned (which seems to be how you're trying to use it), but that the subpattern does not return as its own entry in the array of matches.",0
681,"\w+\d+\w+ means ""one or more word characters, followed by one or more digit, followed by one or more word character"", where a 'word' character is a letter, a number or an underscore.",0
683,"note that i've replaced $str1 with ' ' in the string rather than removing it, since if $str was, for example, ""applehellobanana"", you would want to return 'apple' and 'banana' as separate matches, rather than just matching 'applebanana'.",0
684,"if you want to return the whole thing as a single string, which appears to be your intention then you'll need to implode your matches with something along the lines of",0
685,"then if you wanted to replace that, you could do this using preg_replace :",0
687,i don't see what's wrong with your code.,0
690,try using mysql_real_escape_string() instead of addslashes() .,0
691,"for debugging, you might calculate the md5() of the string before inserting into db and then after retrieving it.",0
692,"i bet you're going to get different hashes, meaning you're not inserting it correctly and your binary data gets corrupted when inserted into the db.",0
693,"in order to create the mysql, mysqli and pdo extensions, php must be compiled against a mysql interface library.",0
696,the reason for the switch to the native library is that the mysql-provided library is released under the gpl.,0
697,"the php license is not compatible with the gpl, so distributing php binaries compiled against gpl code is pretty high up on the thou shalt not list.",0
698,you can thank and/or curse the mysql folks for this bit of utter stupidity.,0
699,only idiots and evil people release library code under the gpl.,0
702,you might want to explore other options for a secure connection to your mysql server.,0
703,"you should also consider openvpn , a vpn solution built on top of ssl/tls.",0
704,you can use this to establish a secure connection between the two machines without needing to worry about protocol-level security.,0
705,"for this situation, if you need to insert values for undefined fields, use empty() .",0
707,"there are many questions about this, for example look here .",0
708,2) don't use the @ before file_get_contents this will suppress error (warning in this case) when your file request fails.,0
709,"because of that - json_encode will omit the keys in the first array (and keep it as array object), while in the second array - the json_encode will look at your array as object and will keep the keys.",0
711,if you want to decode html entities you could first use php's built-in html_​entity_​decode() function in autocomplete.php :,0
712,"take a look at jqueryui's doc , you can use this to build your own &lt;li&gt; element, so that would be something like :",0
713,"the php code you put in your files is not executed at javascript run time, it is executed even before the page gets sent to the client.",0
714,"so you can't access $_session from anywhere within your content , you need to do that from wordpress's code .",0
715,usually this is done via a plugin .,0
716,you need to pass your javascript variables to a server side php .,0
717,"as @grasshopper said, the best (or at least most maintainable way) is through ajax:",0
718,"on the server, you need to create a specific file to accept the incoming variables (it would be best if you did this from a plugin, in order not to add files outside the installation: such practices are frowned upon by security scanners such as wordfence).",0
719,this here below is a butcher's solution.,0
721,then it will be available everywhere in wordpress.,0
722,provided you have access to wp-config.php .,0
723,"also, backup wp-config first and use a full ftp client to do it; do not use a wordpress plugin to edit it , since if wp-config crashes, the plugin may crash too... and you'll find yourself in a my-can-opener-is-locked-within-a-can situation.",0
724,"if you don't feel comfortable with some of the above, it's best if you do nothing.",0
725,or practice first on an expendable wordpress installation that you can reinstall easily.,0

729,1st parameter of array_diff : the trimmed version of $my_array .,0
731,it is good to use the trimmed version in case an element contains a string that is nothing but whitespace (i.e.,0
732,"tabs, spaces), which i assume would also want to be removed.",0
735,output: an array of elements that are contained in the 1st array that are not also contained in the 2nd array.,0
736,"in this case, because '' , null , and false are within the 2nd array, they can never be returned by array_diff .",0
737,it turns out you don't need to have null and false in the 2nd array.,0
739,if you are going to use all those fields you should test that they all exist rather than just the first one.,0
740,"remember isset() can test more than one field at a time, like this :",0
742,the array_map call is done at the end to convert the item/title keys into numerical ones.,0
743,you don't need json encode after the loop as things are.,0
744,"your array values are already json strings, which means that using json_encode will only escape the strings!",0
747,the only thing -&gt;write does is parse a dot notated set path (which would look like foo.bar.x ) which you are not doing.,0
748,and echo debug information if you are watching particular values.,0
749,it shouldn't hurt if you modify $_session directly.,0
750,your are overwriting the last product in the cart.,0
751,"if you need multiple conditions, just separate them with and :",0
752,no need to use where again.,0
753,just like you wouldn't need to use if() more than once if you were writing a complex condition in php.,0
754,"ps: this isn't directly related to your question, but you should get into the habit of not putting $_post or $_get variables directly into your sql queries.",0
755,it's a good way to get hacked!,0
762,you have an anchor tag on which you have an onclick event.,0
763,onclick event when fired will send an ajax request to testajax.php?,0
764,"however since you haven't prevented default behaviour of clicking an anchor tag, as soon as this ajax request is sent, page will redirect to ?process and where ofcourse you will have nothing to receive as $_get parameters.",0
766,"also since on server side you have a clause like if(isset($_get['process'])) { , you should also update your ajax url to something like: testajax.php?process",0
772,"second, you have no error checking.",0
773,without knowing what your variables contain i suggest you try something like this:,0
775,"the issue was within the sha1 talking to the database, where by sha1 is a (40) strong and the database was set to (20).",0
776,an annoying issue but it has not been resolved.,0
777,"var_dump was used to talk to the database to prove that the information being entered was correct, it did however show that the password held in the database was (20) and the password entered for login was (40).",0
778,"first, it would be easier to use an array for specifying multiple ids in the url:",0
779,"this way, in your php code $_get['var'] will be an array and will contain all values specified in the url.",0
782,"finally, you have to use where in in your query (and verify of course if there are actually some values in the $ids array before executing the sql query):",0
783,"this won't affect the entities involved in the markup ( * and ` ), and you can also set the double_encode flag to false ensure that already-encoded content (e.g.",0
784,&amp; characters in links) does not get encoded twice -- see the php manual for the settings :,0
786,here's an example from the code formatting regex:,0
788,"a quick explanation of how preg_replace works: when you use parentheses in a regular expression, you capture the matter within those parentheses to the special variables $1, $2, $3, etc.",0
789,"the contents of the first set of parentheses are in $1 , the contents of the second set in $2 , and so on.",0
790,"for example, take this regular expression:",0
791,"and the input string bread and butter , bread matches the expression in the first set of parens and butter matches the expression in the second set; $1 would be set to bread and $2 to butter.",0
792,"this becomes useful when we do preg_replace , as we can use $1 and $2 in the replacement string:",0
802,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i wouldn't use `mysql_` methods, their getting deprecated.it its advisable to use pdo or mysqli.also i would be careful with your '$sql' variable there , its very vulnerable to injection, imagine if some one enters this :"" ' or 1 = '1 "" (without the double quotes) in your password field.",0
805,you might also want to check the manuals for pdo and mysqli:,0
807,you are using a custom mail header from .,0
808,from is used in spam filters.,0
809,"if i would enter my mail address, and you are sending this mail with from: my@mail , you are impersonating my own email server.",0
810,"spam used to use this to hide the real source, and to redirect complaints and error feedback to the unhappy guy behind that mail address.",0
811,because of this today there are mechanisms that will prevent such abuse.,0
812,so just do not pretend i am sending this mail - you do.,0
813,"if you want to be able to answer me with a click on the reply button, use the reply-to header, but always use from: dont-answer@yourwebsite.example .",0
814,"additionally, these custom headers are the entry point for bad things.",0
815,make sure you are only adding mail addresses.,0
816,make sure you do not add any line feed characters.,0
817,"these would make the mailserver think that there is a new header coming up, and this might lead to mail header injection.",0
818,"as you can read from array_multisort documentation, only associative (string) keys are preserved.",0
822,the differences between isset and empty are subtle but important.,0
823,they are most relevant when used alone.,0
824,if you are checking that a variable exists and is a truethy value (e.g.,0
825,any string that is not all spaces or 0s) you can use either interchangeably.,0
829,avoid writing code that issues notices/warnings that you are ignoring.,0
836,or you can group your related fields directly by changing the structure:,0
838,the get method contains the information in the url and can be easy copied and hacked.,0
839,what is happening is that your value v is not the same as the implied value of $_post['v'] .,0
840,"as stated by tim, there is no $v = statement so in effect your echo output is outputting nothing multiplied by 2.",0
842,"ok, first stop then is to see what is on line 11?",0
844,if you do not see a value for 'v' (and i guess you probably won't) then that means this value wasn't set in the previous html page so go back and check that your form submits an input such as:,0
845,"can you confirm your post is as intended, and that you do want post which means you need to submit the form rather than get or another method, such as index.php?v=10 ?",0
847,"this will not break your code, but it could be nice to add this line above your if statement:",0
848,what's actually happening with that error is that your variable $v isn't being initialized because the code has not enter the if condition.,0
850,therefore is pretty normal the error you are having.,0
852,a better code/logic would be you to set up the default value of the variable in case the is_numeric returns false.,0
853,"i would like to thank everybody who participated this question, the answer is the following: in reality memcache (not memcache d ) as session handler supports comma separated servers as the session.save_path , moreover it supports failover.",0
854,the error mentioned above session start failed.,0
855,original message: session_start(): server 10.0.10.111 (tcp 11211) failed with: connection refused (111) had only 8th (notice) level.,0
857,and then successfully connects to the second server and using it.,0
858,i suggest ditching all of that and using prepared statements in combination with pdo.,0
859,"your code, as it stands, is vulnerable to a sql-injection attack.",0
860,you probably have a newline ( \n or \r\n ) at the end of your file ( $myfile ).,0
862,"this way, every html line has it's separate $htmlarr[] value.",0
863,"moreover, if you need your html to be ""pretty print"", you can simply have some sort of method that will indent your html by prepending whitespaces at the beginning of every array elements depending on somme rule set.",0
864,"for example, if we have :",0
865,"after the question edit by felix kling, i realize that this has nothing to do with the question.",0
866,sorry about that :) thanks though for the clarification.,0
867,because you get an error when decoding a json based message ive posted an way to throw an exception when it happens so you can handle the error on a better way.,0
870,you could also run a urlencode() after all of your functions to the final product just to be on the safe side since you're trying to use dashes instead of %20 for spaces,0
871,data (d=) is exploded on the slashes and passed as an array to every controller method.autoloading (via spl_autoload_register()) is used to call the class (c=) and then the method in that class (m=).,0
872,"also, it sounds like you're either not setting the action on your form or you're deliberately setting the action to get.",0
873,"as a general rule, action should be post to keep the urls sane.",0
874,those can be get with various advantages.,0
875,the problem is that your &lt;?php echo $_session['xnombre'];?&gt; code is generated on the server before the javascript even gets sent to your browser.,0
876,the code inbetween the php &lt;?,0
877,and ?&gt; tags never even get sent to the client at all - it's completely processed by the server.,0
879,"if you view the webpage source and look at your javascript, you'll see what i mean.",0
880,"the problem is you are using the post method to submit the form values so when ever you tries to refresh the browser asks you whether to send the form information or not it is the default behavior of the browser to tackle the posted information, the alternate solution for your problem is you can use the get method like in form attribute method='get' what it does it will append all the information of form in the url which we call the query string and in php code you are accessing the form values in $_post but when using get method the form values will now appear in the $_get method these methods are called request method and are php's global variables, now when you try to refresh it will not ask you to resend information because the information now resides in the url",0
881,instead of using array_unique() you can build a unique array straight away:,0
882,the + operator adds new values to the array if their corresponding keys don't already exist.,0
883,"in the end, you can find the answer by observing the array keys:",0
885,"the only issue may affect only following queries, but not the current one.",0
888,step 2. make sure that you can see all php errors.,0
889,"step 4. run your query without prepared statements, using pdo::query() , with values written by hand:",0
890,"step 5. run with a prepared statement but in a simplified form, to eliminate all possible spelling issues:",0
892,the reason i don't use stristr is because it returns the part of the string following the part you were looking for.,0
895,"instead, it's easier to use strpos , which returns the position where it found the string.",0
896,"if it didn't find it, it returns false .",0
897,"so a quick check for ""is not false"", is enough.",0
899,"prepare is a pdo method, not a method in your dbengine class.",0
900,you can define the method like this:,0
901,you might want to use mysqli or pdo 's prepared queries for what you want to do.,0
902,try this hope it will help you out.,0
903,here we are using array_map for gathering locations.,0
904,you can use an create_function or an anonymous function (php 5.3 >=),0
905,"most languages provide these types of functions (look for packages like collection, iterator, or enumeration/enumerable)...some provide more functions than others and you will commonly see that the functions are named differently across languages (i.e.",0
906,"collect == map, reduce == fold).",0
907,"if a function doesn't exist in your language, you can create it from the ones that do exist.",0
908,as for your test case...we can use array_reduce to implement pluck .,0
909,"the first version i posted relied on array_map ; however, i agree with @salathe that array_reduce is more succinct for this task; array_map is an ok option, but you end up having to do more work in the end.",0
910,"array_reduce can look a bit odd at first, but if the callback is neatly organized, all is well.",0
912,"in the naive implementation below, we assume the structure to be a hash (associative array).",0
913,"here we choose a version of ""pluck"" to call based on the version of php we are running.",0
914,"if you run the entire script, you should get the correct answer no matter what version you are on.",0
915,notice there is no ending '?>'.,0
916,that is because it isn't needed.,0
918,"fwiw, it looks like this is being added to php 5.5 as array_column .",0
920,actually in php it is pretty easy to manage too.,0
921,just use the array_map function as illustrated below.,0
922,"if you have dynamic columns for which you are substituting $x , do not enclose $x in quotes:",0
923,"the proper way to parse a query string in php is with parse_str() , rather than attempting to explode() on the &amp; .",0
924,"however, since you are grabbing the whole query string, and not filtering any specific variables, why not just use $_get ?",0
925,"to help you understand why your code isn't working, i'll modify it here.",0
926,"however, this is not the preferred method of performing this task.",0
927,using foreach($_get) as above is much better.,0
928,indenting the loop properly will help reveal the problem:,0
929,you are getting back multiple results.,0
930,the result of the select as well as the result of the call.,0
931,you can use filter_var and sanitize the string to only include integers.,0
932,you can use a regular expression to match only integers.,0
933,the output of from_addr will be there if you are receiving results from your query.,0
934,"it appears that you are using this field for email, so i would not recommend saving to the database with htmlspecialchars , as you want the emails to send properly.",0
935,"if the above didn't answer your question fully, and you wish to query the database for an email rather than the ""send name"", i would recommend using like :",0
938,"it is a perfectly valid query (in the sense that mysql will interpret and execute it perfectly) but this will lead to a ""cannot access empty property"" fatal error when pdo tries to fetch the data and fetchmode is set to pdo::fetch_obj.",0
939,it looks like things have changed in the current version of codeigniter (2.0.0)...,0
940,the semi-colon in the following is making your loop stop and is an end of statement character.,0
941,"also the quoted zero is interpreted as a string, so you need to remove it.",0
942,"add error reporting to the top of your file(s) right after your opening php tag for example &lt;?php error_reporting(e_all); ini_set('display_errors', 1); then the rest of your code, to see if it yields anything, as well as or die(mysqli_error($con)) to mysqli_query() .",0
943,you need to use isset() or !empty() against your post arrays.,0
944,you also didn't include a submit button and is unknown if you are using one.,0
945,do not use header('location: ./user'); in your ajax.,0
946,"you have some duplicated code, like $result = mysqli_query($conn, ""select * from users where username = '$user'""); why do not you call it only once?",0
948,"you are set the $username from $_post and after that you've checked ths isset($_post) , why is it?",0
949,"anyway, you need to echo a success / failed, or a json object with error and message keys.",0
950,seems like you just haven't pdo extension because syntax is right.on ubuntu/debian you should be able to install the necessary pdo parts from apt using,0
951,"if $db in your code snippet is an instance of pdo, then you could use debugdumpparams() to see the sql",0
953,"your $uploadpriv_ass array's last key is 4, and you're passing the value of 5 to array_key_exists .",0
954,"since $uploadpriv_ass[5] is not set, you're not getting the ""t"".",0
955,read the php documentation on strings .,0
957,"btw, i recommend you refactor your session variable.",0
958,"instead of having separate arrays for each property like firstname , lastname , departureseat , make it an array of associative arrays.",0
959,this will allow you to use foreach ($_session['passengers'] as $p) .,0
960,i think i've got a more complete solution for youthis is a single page php script it will do the following;,0
961,show the form for submission if the user request value isn't present (with the embedded user id value) parse and output the ratings from the form accepts the userid value as a variable when calling the displayform function,0
964,"if anything goes wrong, or you get any errors, leave it in the comments.",0
965,"to find out more about prepared statements and mysqli itself, have a look at the php manual: http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.prepare.php",0
966,the error you're getting is because $_files['uploadfilefield'] is not set.,0
967,"therefore $uploadtmp is never set on your code, and when you get to this line: if(!$uploadtmp) - it fails ( $uploadtmp is indeed undefined at this point).",0
968,you may want to change it to if (!isset($uploadtmp)) .,0
970,"your last condition (empty($_get['lang']) || !isset($_get['lang'])) is redundant itself, since empty already checks if the function is set, as you can read here .",0
971,"also, it is redundant with the first condition.",0
973,"first of all, you can do all of the bad word replacements with one (dynamically generated) regex, like this:",0
974,"now, you have the problem of people adding periods in between the word, which you can search for with another regex and replace them as well.",0
975,"however, you must keep in mind that .",0
976,"matches any character in a regex, and must be escaped (with preg_quote() or a backslash).",0
977,"now, you can use this new $bad_words array just like the above one to replace these obfuscated ones.",0
978,"hint: you can make this array_map() call ""better"" in the sense that it can be smarter to catch more obfuscations.",0
979,"for example, if you wanted to catch a bad word separated with either a period or a whitespace character or a comma, you can do:",0
981,"note that the resulting two-dimensional array will have its dimensions switched, but that is often desirable.",0
982,there will also be a $matches[4] but it does not really have a meaning and is only used inside the regular expression.,0
984,"(.+) will consume as much as possible, and any character.",0
985,so if you have something inside a string value that looks like in 13 then your first repetition might consume everything until there and return it as the column.,0
987,there are two ways around this.,0
988,"either making the repetition ""ungreedy"" by appending ?",0
989,"or, even better, restrict the allowed characters, so you cannot go past the desired delimiter.",0
990,"in my regex i only allow letters, digits and underscores ( \w ) for column identifiers.",0
991,[\t| ] this mixes up two concepts: alternation and character classes.,0
992,"what this does is ""match a tab, a pipe or a space"".",0
993,in character classes you simply write all characters without delimiting them.,0
994,alternatively you could have written (\t| ) which would be equivalent in this case.,0
995,"[.+] i don't know what you were trying to accomplish with this, but it matches either a literal .",0
996,"and again it might be useful to restrict the allowed characters, and to check for correct matching of quotes (to avoid 'some string"" )",0
997,"now for an explanation of my own regex (you can copy this into your code, as well, it will work just fine; plus you have the explanation as comments in your code):",0
998,this makes use of pcre's recursion feature where you can reuse a subpattern (or the whole regular expression) with (?n) (where n is just the number you would also use for a backreference).,0
999,"it does not allow for floating-point numbers it does not allow for escaped quotes (if your value is 'don\'t do this' , i would only captur 'don\' ).",0
1000,this can be solved using a negative lookbehind .,0
1001,it does not allow for empty arrays as values (this could be easily solved by wrapping all parameters in a subpattern and making it optional with ? ),0
1002,"and since you said your regex'ing is horrible... while regular expressions seem like a lot of black magic due to their uncommon syntax, they are not that hard to understand, if you take the time once to get your head around their basic concepts.",0
1003,i can recommend this tutorial .,0
1005,you probably have echo print_r($view) .,0
1006,and... what need do you have to parse its output?,0
1007,there are certainly much better ways to solve your problem.,0
1010,"thus if you echo print_r($foo) you will print the contents of foo, followed by a string representation of the return value (which is 1).",0
1011,"i'm not sure if this is the only problem in your code, but it's definitely one: the currency value inside the data that is passed to php has no key.",0
1012,the correct data to pass would then be:,0
1013,"with this, php should now be able to access $_post['currency'] to get the currency value unless there are other problems.",0
1014,let's assume you have an array containing the lines to insert :,0
1016,"you can of course combine the two first loops, i only separated for the sake of explanation :",0
1017,really you should be using parameter placeholders ( ? ),0
1018,for the values and prepare the statement with pdo or equivalent.,0
1019,you'll be wise to learn to use join statements in sql.,0
1020,this will allow you to use just one sql query to fetch all the results you need.,0
1021,"in the meantime, if you are nesting some sql queries inside others, the outside query (in your case select * from appointments ) needs a separate database connection (in your case $mysqli ) from the rest of the queries.",0
1022,issuing a new query from the connection resets the rest of the queries.,0
1024,instead give a list of columns you need.,0
1025,your software will be more robust and easier to understand if you do that.,0
1026,the implementation of array_values can be found in the php source code here in ext/standard/array.c starting on line 2968.,0
1027,"the implementation is non-destructive, meaning it will create a new array of values based on the given argument array, discarding the keys.",0
1028,the equivalent implementation of this function in php would look something like this...,0
1029,though what you might notice from this implementation is that it doesn't necesarily change the order of your elements in the array at all.,0
1030,it merely recreates the array using number keys starting from 0.,0
1031,notice that baz still comes last even though the key is now 2 instead of 0 .,0
1032,this may not necessarily be what you want if i understand your requirements correctly.,0
1033,"1) you dont seem to be assigning any value to $_session['logged_in'], hence your first assertion mighr be returning true.",0
1034,why not check if the 'current_user' is set instead?,0
1035,"2) you are using an exact equality operator (read: !==) at this line: $_session['logged-in'] !== trueif it is not (of type boolean and true) or ($_session does not exist) the assertion will always be true, leading to the login page.",0
1037,"i've slightly re written this for my own mind to process it, but my initial thought is that for oo programming you're using a procedural way of entering data into the database, how about this:",0
1038,i think it would be wise to add in if statments checkin the mysql executed successfully.,0
1040,"however, if you use php $_session variable, it will persist.",0
1044,here is a post with some helpful ajax beginner info -- it links to another post containing some simple ajax examples.,0
1045,i think the best way to handle this would be to use the filter_input() function.,0
1046,that would strip everything from $_post['amount'] that isn't a numerical digit.,0
1047,of course it requires the use of php5.2 or greater.,0
1048,"well, obviously $row = mysqli_fetch_array($link, $useridquery) fetches an array of results.",0
1049,print_r($row) is then printing that array to the output stream and returns true which is concatenated to the string as 1 .,0
1050,"the remaining two errors are things that you should deal with by actually looking, yourself, at the difference between mysql_connect() and mysqli_connect() .",0
1051,"mysql_connect() ’s first argument, $server , can be formatted like hostname:port whereas with mysqli_connect() you would pass only hostname to its first argument and pass port as an optional fifth parameter.",0
1052,"also, mysqli would have you specify the database in the mysqli_connect() call instead of having a separate function analogous to mysql_select_db() .",0
1053,"i suggest that, if you need, you use the converter tool to convert all of your sourcecode from mysql to mysqli except for these lines with the warnings in them.",0
1054,"only you know what format ""$localhost"" comes in: if it might contain port information, you must separate the port information out.",0
1055,you should probably set the database to use in mysqli_connect() instead of using the converter’s automatic use $db shim.,0
1056,this is exactly what the converter is trying to tell you :-).,0
1057,"the above suggests that the php code generated by the converter is, itself, throwing php warnings and errors at runtime (not that the converter is complaining about your original code or informing you that you need to actually do some manual conversion as i discussed above).",0
1058,that is why we were looking for errors like the once-missing semicolon which you corrected.,0
1060,"to prevent any javascript, you could use strip_tags in concert with htmlspecialchars .",0
1062,"if you need to store plain text, just pass it through mysql_real_escape_string() before storing it.",0
1063,"you can also use preg_match() or preg_replace() to make sure you are only storing valid values (different patterns for different uses, e.g.",0
1064,most people create a wrapper class around the pdo object to record the queries as they are sent to the database.,0
1066,looks like $this-&gt;updates is not empty but its not an array.,0
1067,you can use the is_array test before you use it in foreach :,0
1069,"if it's empty, it doesn't matter, the foreach will simply do nothing...",0
1070,or if the foreach is not the only processing you do :,0
1071,the data you are posting to register.php from your ajax call needs to be a single json like this (notice the added {} around the fields):,0
1072,from this change you wil be able to access the fields inside the $_post associative array.,0
1073,which should address the php error.,0
1074,and within the loop you can evaluate whether each key found by the loop matches your criteria.,0
1075,i'm not 100% sure what is actually real and what is just a placeholder in your question though.,0
1076,maybe i took something for solid fact that actually isn't.,0
1077,you might need to explain your wishes in more detail.,0
1078,"you would do well to read up on mysqli , which is a safer way to carry out mysql queries.",0
1080,i'm only looking at your pdo code.,0
1081,it seems your missing some code how do you want to get your mysql data.,0
1082,i created a similar script for you that works a little different.,0
1084,i'm not sure why think that.,0

1090,"when you read from $_post , you should pass your arguments in the http body instead of using the querystring.",0
1091,you would need to send your arguments as in the following example:,0
1092,"in your case, you are adding the query string to the url, which means that it is being passed as a get variable.",0
1093,"even if it is a post request, php can still access any get variables added on as a query string.",0
1094,"based on your code, i don't think you are telling the request what info should be included in the post section of the request, which would explain why you are not seeing anything with $_post['var'] .",0
1095,"but since $_request['var'] looks for request variables in get and post and any cookies passed in the request, you see the variable as it was passed via the query string.",0
1096,"if you want to use post the right way, you need to not point the request to a url that has a query string and instead define that query string as the post data.",0
1097,"though, there is other problems, your query has 0 protection from injection.",0
1100,and make sure to hash their password and compare against the hash.,0
1102,"you can use filter_var filter_var('http://example.com', filter_validate_url); for validating your urls.here you can find all types of validation types you can use.if you want to require the http(s) you can add use this.",0

1154,or you could explode it into an array then use in_array() :,0
1156,"i'm not sure about the code (will review later) but you could try refactoring your tables so you have a separate table that contains user attributes, this allows you to be dynamic with your attributes so you don't have to create a different table every time you have a different type of user.",0

1158,the reason you are encountering invalid sequences is because the encoding for your php-file is incorrect.,0
1159,"note that if you are using utf-8 properly, you do not need to use htmlentities.",0

1168,"from php 5.3, the json_hex options allow you to ensure all html-special characters are encoded as javascript string literal escapes, so you don't have to html-encode on top of json-encoding, which means you can use the same output function in both event handler attributes and &lt;script&gt; blocks (which, being cdata, have no html-escaping).",0
1170,this tends to be more readable.,0
1172,"after all, you are not outputting any html that contain the posted values.",0

1237,"mysql_ is with php 5.5 deprecated and won't be supported by php >= 5.5.in addition to this i should mention, that your script is vulnerable for mysql injections.",0

1241,"so you can get your value1 using $_post['field1] , value2 with $_post['field2']",0
1242,the comments say it all but i'll sum up.,0
1243,php as a server side language is evaluated before the code reaches your browser - on the other hand javascript as a client side language executes only after your browser has received the information from the server.,0
1245,an example ajax request (from http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_php.asp ):,0
1246,php warning notices must have been turned off on your live server.,0
1247,"well, you can enable it like",0
1248,"try checking those files for session_start(); occurence.. if so.. comment it off , since you have already started in the beginning of your code.",0
1252,"so whatever the order you choose to make the two kinds of replacement, the problem stay the same.an other thing, the preg_match tests are useless, if you want to stop the replacements when there are no more replacements to do, use the ""count"" parameter of preg_replace and use a do...while loop to test it.",0
1254,"most of the time you don't need to capture the content between markers in a template system, i will show you an example for the fake replacement you use in your question, but you can expand the same idea to your real case:",0
1255,i think your core problem is that you're only clearing things in the outer loop.,0
1256,"$c = new curl for instance is going to allocate memory to the heap for each iteration of the inner loop, but you're only unset ing the last instance.",0
1258,"is it possible to instantiate curl once outside the loop, and then inside keep reusing the same instance.",0
1259,you could reset all fields to null in the loop if you wanted.,0
1260,you might want to change and use this code instead if you are just going to send or $_get['username'] an value from your previous session.,0
1263,"in your code example, you never assign these post values to these session values.",0
1265,note that this will yield true even if the property is null .,0
1266,to check whether a property exists and that it's not null you use isset() :,0
1267,following on from @shawnmehan 's and @jigar 's comments and from my own - i have not been able to test this where i am but it might serve to point you in a direction for what you need.,0
1268,"not sure how many rows of arrays you have in each file, so i have used a loop but if there is only one line, you will only need the fgets() .",0
1271,"if, at any point in your data, there is one or more single quotes your query will fail and trigger the die() statement.",0
1272,"you can either scrub every variable to remove or replace these characters, or you can move away from the deprecated mysql_* functions and use parameterized queries with mysqli or pdo.",0
1273,you won't have to scrub special characters out of your input.,0
1274,your code will be less susceptible to sql injection.,0
1276,your code will not break in future versions of php when these functions are removed.,0
1277,"most importantly, peopel will stop endlessly harping on you about the functions you use while ignoring your actual question.",0
1279,"i have had a similar issue before, though i needed to make sure that the values are not duplicated, and if there is a duplicate then a page should show me a notification.",0
1280,the method i am using is different.,0

1282,"might not be exactly what you are looking for, but i hope it helps.",0
1284,this is only done for form-based content types.,0
1285,you must instead read from php raw input.,0
1286,"any time you find yourself manually building json strings, you should ask yourself if you should really be doing that.",0
1287,json is a serialization format and should not be created manually in most cases.,0
1288,"you have some syntax issues in your code, your else statements were not lined up properly, so your page was not working.",0
1289,"(for example, you had an } else { lined up with another } else { ).",0
1291,it helps us read the code and more importantly it will help you debug your code .,0
1292,take a quick look at a coding standard for your own benefit.,0
1293,you may be asked to amend this code in a few weeks/months and you will thank me in the end.,0
1294,"i also suggest, for really complex, nested structures, to comment what each ending bracket goes to like i did in your code.",0
1297,these are sql statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters.,0
1298,this way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious sql.,0
1302,on controller echo $this->uri->segment(3) make sure you are getting correct,0
1303,the big problem came in your attempt to modify the current array.,0
1304,"this will prove more difficult than it is worth, when you can just create a new array and set the key/value combos based on the exploded value from the initial array.",0
1305,"also, notice my shortcut with the use of list() .",0
1307,"alternatively, you can also use the file() function with the file_ignore_new_lines parameter.",0
1308,"because you are trying to print the array as if automagically transforms itself into javascript array, that is, a string of its values separated by a comma (that is what it needs to output to the html, something the browser understands).",0
1309,it takes every element in the array and puts $glue string between every one of them.,0
1310,the end result looks like this:,0
1311,"sqlite doesn't support the values (...), (...), (...) syntax (see the docs ).",0
1312,so you need to do only one row per insert query...,0
1313,"the reason for the error itself is that since there's a query error, pdo::prepare() returns false .",0
1314,you should check it to make sure the -&gt;prepare() call worked:,0
1315,"i'm guessing 'accept_proof' is the name of your submit button, so, because it's being disabled before the form is submitted, its value is not set in the post to the server; isset($_post['accept_proof']) is returning false, and your code inside the if isn't executing.",0

1321,i can help to guide you to it.,0
1323,"a good idea is to put uniqure key on both username,post_id,comment so that a user cannot say exact same comment on same post twice.",0
1326,you can treat it as an array and access it like $_post['themestack'][0] .,0
1327,shameless plug: i do this exact thing in a project i have on github .,0
1328,feel free to use the classes for whatever you like; they are mostly copy-pastable.,0
1329,"the error call to a member function ... on a non-object in ... means that $db is not an object, which means that it was not instantiated to an object.",0
1330,"bind_param(string $format, mixed &amp;*vars); uses pass-by-reference and if this fails, it throws an error.try it yourself by sticking this in there:",0
1332,you could check to see if any of the keys in $_get intersect with $active_links :,0
1333,"if array_key_diff returns an empty array, all those keys exist in the $_get array.",0
1334,this is not an issue of zf2.,0
1335,there is a serialized object in your session which php tries to unserialize when session_start is called.,0
1336,"but because php can't find the class (which is not declared), it uses __php_incomplete_class instead.",0
1337,the best way to fix: register an autoloader to load missing classes.,0
1338,you can dump the class name this way:,0
1339,you are using json_decode() to display the data inside var_dump but do not save the decoded array to a variable you can use later on.,0
1340,have you checked to see if a cookie is being set?,0
1341,session_start() should only ever be called once.,0
1342,"it would probably make sense to shove it into a bootstrap file, and include that from each of your pages.",0
1344,"but in a real-word scenarion, the profile page of the user would use a database as well.according to your code, you would have to implement the same database handler twice or even more... (see comments below)",0
1345,"basically, you should never trust client-side validation, because anyone could just simply disable javascript in a browser.",0
1346,"and then he can easily send ""invalid"" data to the php script.",0
1347,always do server-side validation!but it does not mean that you should never use client-side validation at all.,0
1348,"instead you should handle a situation when they come from browsers that do not have js enabled/support.you can try it yourself, just disable javascript in your browser and then enter your site...",0
1350,this is how this should not be.here i'm saying about both javascript and php codes...,0
1351,"i'm not sure if you are going to follow above advices (in case you don't have a time or a will), so that let me answer your original question first.",0
1352,in short: this is a php variable !,0
1353,"and thus should be set in phpand it soulds like to me, even if you set $logged_in to true once a user logs in, you've missed somewhere session_start() .howewer, don't use this variable at all!",0
1354,"instead define a function, like, is_user_logged() because it's more reliable and ""catchable"" if something goes wrong.ok, next,",0
1356,your question isn't clear still i'm answering it.,0
1357,it is straightforward to begin and commit a transaction.,0
1358,"in pdo, do something like this:",0
1359,"first of all, you start a transaction next, you query database if result is okay, commit the transaction if result is not okay, rollback and the query will not execute",0
1361,"by default, pdo auto-commits each query.",0
1363,"in general scenario, you should not turn it off.",0
1364,"when you need to execute an important query, i.e multi-part queries that depend on each other for their final result like an amount transfer between two accounts (where you need to deduct amount from one table and to add it to another table), simply begin a transaction.",0
1365,pdo will not execute any query until you commit the transaction.,0
1366,"if something goes wrong, everything will be rolled back to its previous state.",0
1367,"lastly, there isn't any big difference between turning off auto-commit and beginning a transaction.",0
1391,the error message explains exactly what the issue is.,0
1392,"the name variable is not set when you first load the page, because nothing has been posted yet.",0
1394,that's what the php error is telling you.,0
1395,you'll need to replace all of your $_post inside the form with this: &lt;?php if (isset($_post['name'])){ echo htmlspecialchars($_post['name']); } ?&gt; so you won't see those errors anymore.,0
1396,"also, you should be using $_post, not $_post.",0
1398,"however, it's not reccomended because if there is a real error you won't know what it is until you remove that line.",0
1399,if you move the array_pop to outside the if you should be ok.,0
1400,just find the place in your code which does htmlspecialchars/htmlentities on the data intended for database and get rid of it.,0
1401,note that your query is improperly formatted.,0
1402,"you have to format it, either by formatting every literal separately, or by using prepared statements.",0
1404,"mysql won't sanitize your html like this, as far as i know, so something in your code is passing your $_post['omschrijving'] through htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars() .",0
1405,either of these functions would produce the out put that your are seeing in your database.,0
1406,if you have any other doubts just do a print_r($_server); to actually see how the array is composed,0
1408,"store the previous url (or know it) and redirect to it with header(""location: old_page.php""); make the target of the form an iframe.",0
1409,this means the main page itself will not redirect and you can just bubble a response from upload_file.php (which will load in the iframe) making seamless uploading for your app.,0
1410,also this is not the best way to get a file extension:,0
1411,even though this is a tiny usage of in_array i still would recommend taking that out and using a more practical method of searching arrays: http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php,0
1412,here is a working form with some checkboxes that will allow you to test and get the sql you intended.,0
1413,you can simply check the textbox to make sure it isn't empty and then append to a sql string:,0
1415,you are not defining $date - although its not even necessary in your example.,0
1416,the date() function will default to today if no second parameter is passed in.,0
1417,(also isset can take a comma separated list of variables to be cleaner),0
1418,"also, as mentioned in the comments, you have a typo in your switch statement that would prevent a match on 'sat'.",0
1419,"if they all have their own static ip, store the ip in the session, and compare every time the page loads.",0
1420,"if $_server['remote_addr'] != $_session['ip'] , somebody's trying to steal a session.",0
1421,this checks if the submit button was clicked if(isset($_post['submit'])) then it checks for user match database records and then if it is correct it logs the user in also remember to set session variables,0
1422,you could use $_session[] to store values so that you can use it again until you done.,0
1423,what you are looking for is called persistent data.,0
1424,you need some data to exist over a longer period of time than just an http request (a page load).,0
1425,"in order to do that, you have to store the data somewhere more permanent.",0
1427,you can store the data in a file.,0
1428,you can store the data in a cookie/session.,0
1429,"using cookies/sessions is very similar to just creating a variable and storing the value you need in it, except that php saves this data onto a file (either on the client's machine or your server) and loads the data into the variables for you automatically before the script starts, so you don't have to think much about how to handle the file that's created.",0
1431,"php will automatically load that file into a global array named $_cookie , which you can use on any script in that domain e.g.",0
1432,www.domain.com for the next 24 hours.,0
1434,your problem is that you're using var_dump in your php.,0
1435,"that literally returns the string: ""bool(true)"" .",0
1437,"if you just want to return the posted value, do this:",0
1438,"just keep in mind that you need to pass the data to the post , correctly:",0
1439,since you are overriding the constructor function of the mysqli class you need to call it manually like so:,0
1440,"if i'm understanding this correctly, you just don't know how to call another file.",0
1441,"i would suggest turning it into a function, including, and then calling it.",0
1444,"(just google it, plenty is out there) this will also allow you to use prepared statements, which is one of the biggest things the mysql_* functions are missing.",0
1445,"since you're using your post data multiple times, place them into local variables to start.",0
1446,"it will make your code short, cleaner, easier to read, and if you ever change the name of a field, must easier to update in the future.",0
1448,"that way if it's successful, you only have to check one thing, and if it fails, you only have to send one thing back to the user.",0
1450,you can use preg_replace_callback and change all the keys without to loop on each using array_keys and array_combine :,0
1451,you can modify the second function to deal with multidimensional arrays:,0
1454,"these tasks have nothing to do with the other, and so it is best to implement them as separate functions.",0
1455,lets start with a higher-order function maparraykeys .,0
1456,"it will accept a mapping function and apply this function to each key of the array, producing a new array.",0
1457,we must expect the mapping function to be injective (one-to-one).,0
1458,there are a few fiddly bits that i do not consider so important.,0
1459,"you may not want to do type hinting on the parameters, okay fine.",0
1460,"maybe you'd rather if/then/else instead of a ternary operator, okay fine.",0
1461,what is important is that with maparraykeys you can apply any (injective) mapping function to array keys.,0
1462,the second task is to convert strings to camel-case.,0
1463,"you might use pcre functions for this, that's fine.",0
1465,"the function undertocamel is not necessarily injective, so you have to take special care.",0
1466,"you have to assume that for all x_y and all xy (where y is the capitalized version of y) that exactly one of x_y , xy , x_y is an underscore format (same follows more more underscores).",0
1467,first it should be noted that nested functions are not actually as abnormal as you'd think.,0
1468,"this is an expression that uses a lot of nested functions: +, -, *, / .",0
1471,the same goes for reading expressions like the one i used.,0
1472,"lastly i can write it to read right-to-left or inside-to-out (if you consider the parentheses), which is how it was originally written.",0
1473,"all of these versions use a simple pattern called function composition , which is another reason it is easy to read and understand.",0
1474,with function composition you can build up a sequence of functions where each function feeds from the output of the previous function.,0
1475,"make sure you have proper indentation, or else you are going to get lost quickly.",0
1478,"also note that you are first doing a post request to maps_append.php which will have both $_post['cmdview'] and $_post['cmd'] set to the options you sent, then once that script has returned a response, you make a get request by using the load() method, which will then replace the html in #append .",0
1479,not sure why there is that last change() at the end.,0
1480,"from what i can tell, it sounds more like you're trying to do something more like this:",0
1481,i believe that what you're are trying to accomplish can be resolved with much simpler code.,0
1482,try replacing your existing javascript with this:,0
1484,this should make it so you can access the value of #cmdview in your php code with $_get['cmd'] .,0
1485,"you can edit your code to include preg_match(""/^envelop-to: (.",0
1488,"you can solve this by doing all the replacements at once, by giving arrays of search and replacement strings to str_replace() .",0
1489,echo $_cookie['foo'] gives you the content of the cookie with the name 'foo'.,0
1490,do not use a single cookie for every value you need.,0
1492,"to get around this, you could use a hidden input in your form:",0
1493,then you can replace isset($_post['submit']) with isset($_post['id']) and set $newappid = $_post['id'] to get the row number to be changed.,0
1494,database/mysql: if you're using set names and e.g.,0
1495,php/mysql you're leaving mysql_real_escape_string() in the dark about the change in character encoding.,0
1497,"so, if you're relying on an escape function like mysql_real_escape_string (because you're not using prepared statements) set names is a suboptimal solution.that's why mysql_set_charset() has been introduced or why gentoo applies a patch that adds the config parameter mysql.connect_charset for both php/mysql and php/mysqli.",0
1498,the client usually doesn't indicate the encoding of the parameters it sends.,0
1499,if you expect utf-8 encoded data and treat it as such there may be encoding errors (byte sequences that are invalid in utf-8).,0
1500,so the data may not display as expected or a parser may abort the parsing.,0
1501,"but at least the user input cannot ""escape"" and do more harm e.g.",0
1502,in an inline sql statement or html output.,0
1503,"take the script (saved as iso-8859-1 or utf-8, doesn't matter)",0
1504,"e4f6fc is not a valid utf-8 byte sequence, therefore htmlspecialchars returns an empty string.",0
1506,"one possible alternative would be to hide and show the ""vid"" text input instead of trying to overwrite it with a hidden input.",0
1507,"to do that, you would change your php to write the text input version of the ""ivaovid"" row, then change your javascript to this:",0
1508,another option would be to hide and show the text input without modifying the value and ignore the value in your php post handler depending on the value of $_post['ivao'] .,0
1509,you need to implode the array.,0
1510,this will put it into a string for you.,0
1512,aslong as the date have date[] in the name it will populate the input::get('date');,0
1514,"if you do echo json_encode(array($json)) then you will get your whole json wrapped in an array, something like this",0
1516,(i'll do a new answer because i misunderstood the question in the other one.),0
1519,turn on error reporting to see if this is the case (see below).,0
1521,you can get around that by using implode and range instead to generate the same string:,0
1522,however the resulting code is still hard to read.,0
1523,"if you are sending json data, it would make much more sense to just send the raw data and build the html client side with javascript.",0
1528,so you should use empty() function for that.,0
1529,"the reason why your code isn't working is not because of your boolean logic, but because of your use of isset() .",0
1531,use $_post['fieldname'] != '' instead to determine if the user has entered a value.,0
1533,"okay, in all seriousness, it's not so much bad as it is silly .",0
1534,you're wrapping pdo in another class.,0
1535,"if you want to add more functionality to pdo, you should be extending it instead.",0
1536,pdo already does this during day to day operations.,0
1537,"when you prepare a query, it returns a pdostatement object.",0
1544,"if you don't want to bind one variable at a time (and i don't blame you), that's what execute 's optional array argument is for.",0
1545,i'm guessing $_post['cat'] is an array in itself.,0
1546,(i'm guessing this because of the [] following cat in your example.),0
1547,"if this is the case, then in your example, you're setting $_session['cat[]'] equal to a variable name that doesn't exist.",0
1548,try setting $_session['cat'] equal to $_post['cat'] .,0
1549,"i.e., 'cat' is the index of the _post array, and the element that it refers to is another array.",0
1550,but it is a little bit different that i needed.,0
1551,i wanted to execute sql queries from the model.,0
1552,after spending more time testing and experimenting i think i figured it out.,0
1553,"just in case if someone has the same need to be able execute mysql queries from the model, here the way i figured it out.",0
1554,"i'm not sure if impacts the performance, but it works.",0
1557,here is how i have done it.,0
1558,"at the bootstrap, when setting di class for the database connection, you can include the options....",0
1561,"so, in your script which do the job you can directly use the value in your $_get entry.",0
1569,"since you are checking if the session is set without starting the sessions, your code will fail.",0
1570,"you said that you called session_start() at the top of your login page, but you did not mention your other pages.",0
1572,"i generally put my session_start() logic, along with a snippet of code for logging the user out after a period of inactivity, in an include file and then include it at the top of every page.",0
1574,"if the index is not set, running isset() on that index within $_get returns false.",0
1576,first of all turn on error reporting (find it in php.ini in xamp/php/bin),0
1577,the problem is most likely the fact that you're doing:,0
1578,"if you have multiple rows, you can loop over them with",0
1579,"first off, if this is returning only one row, you don't need a foreach .",0
1580,"second, you are over-complicating adding the new ip address to the array.",0
1582,"i'm not really sure what you trying to accomplish, but if you want to write some data to a file (for example), you could try something like this:",0
1583,"will expand variable in place (1), if a variable $dbuser exists, because you are using double quotes.with single quotes you will need string concatenation operator .",0
1586,"better yet, you're already using mysqli, so use a prepared statement instead.",0
1587,"if you're using mysqli, you may be using innodb, and it maybe that transactions are implicitly on, and auto-commit for the connection is off, so you may not be committing the transaction, at least if one is in effect.",0
1591,your form method is post so you need to add hidden field to embed/save the id (value from $_get) so when you submit this form you will get value from textarea as well as correct id value using $_post['id'] .,0
1593,and $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('username') is equal to $_post['username'] .,0
1594,this is what i advise you to use (it requires modification of your html though),0
1595,"from my understanding you want to pass _get variables for the error codes, right?",0
1597,"as you are working with codeigniter, you can use the uri structure of the framework and instead of working with _get work with the mvc structure.",0
1598,"then in your controller for the login, in the error method:",0
1599,"if you still need to work with _get variables, that is possible as well.",0
1600,go to the main application config file of the framework /aplication/config/config.php and have a look on the enable query strings section,0
1601,"by adding ?goto=xyz to a url, you are adding the goto parameter (with the value xyz ) to the http get request.",0
1602,php is capable of understanding these parameters.,0
1603,the only thing you have to do in order to access it's value is to read the corresponding value of php's built-in $_get array like so:,0
1604,"your while is not executing, probably because you don't have any returned values from database.",0
1609,"if you want to get hacked, that's cool.",0
1610,"if not, maybe look into pdo instead.",0
1611,name the array something other than $search.,0
1612,"it probably isn't the problem, but it looks odd to have the array created by explode() carry the name of the string being exploded.",0
1613,"try something like $searched = explode("" "", $search); and then use $searched in the subsequent foreach() loop.",0
1614,what if the user only puts in one search term?,0
1615,"if there is no space in $text_field then explode will return an empty array, which should thoroughly jack up your query.",0
1616,you should at least verify that there is a space in $text_field before exploding $search.,0
1618,"again you are going to get ""funny results"" because you will get results that you don't want along with duplicated results as the query extends itself to both of the words in a term individually.",0
1620,"assuming you already have an email and you are looking just for a flag to see whether there is such a user or not, the code will be",0
1621,"note that you should avoid unnecessary loops that suggested in the other answer, as it will complicate the code with no reason.",0
1622,"1) as said in comments, sql injection is a major worry.",0
1624,as for preventing something from messing up with your db?,0
1625,"it assumes iso-8859 , etc... you should always use htmlentities when writing content to the user.",0
1626,not when getting content from the user.,0
1627,take a look into prepared statements to escape sql properly.,0
1628,2) after validating the user you're sending the md5'ed password back and forth as a cookie.,0
1629,non salted md5 is easlly decrypted using one of the many rainbow tables out there.,0
1630,just see how easy it is to crack a non-salted password.,0
1631,and this isn't a good enough session key.,0
1632,"if you want to take sessions out of the server and the database for massive scalling see what laravel/php, play framework/java and others are doing inspired on ror/ruby - encrypted cookies.",0
1633,you might consider to make your code a bit more readable:,0
1634,using in_array seems to be easier to maintain and better to read than a long logical expression.,0
1635,also note that the loop is only necessary if the position of the value 7:1 isn't determined.,0
1636,"you referenced to your $value and $value1 , and then unset them.",0
1637,"do not use references, instead of that, update the value like this:",0
1640,it looks like you're passing $value to the onclick event.,0
1642,"to fix this, use javascript to get the selected value from the radio and append that to the onclick redirect.",0
1643,"better yet, your load.php file should just simple check the 'files' key in your $_post and use that, instead of using get.",0
1646,strip_tags is sufficient to get rid of xss issues.,0
1648,browsers are extremely forgiving and allow even malformed html that's not standards-compliant (also ie bugs).,0
1649,that's why it is pretty much unfeasible to use a regex for that.,0
1650,"(despite the silly so meme it is possible to match html with a contemporary regex language, just way too much effort.)",0
1651,"your $datospost is overwritten inside the while loop in every iteration, try adding an array at the begining of your code like $myarr = array(); and after you fill $datospost add it to $myarr with array_push($myarr, $datospost) ( you can do this after the if statement,",0
1652,"also try var_dump($datospost ); inside the while loop to see if it's actually getting updated,",0
1653,"you can add echo 'here'; inside if ($x['deprecated_nodeid'] == $data[0]) to see if your code actually gets into the if statement,",0
1654,you were pulling a query statement in the middle of a while whereyou're still retrieving the previous statement.,0
1655,this would requirepulling the data into multiple arrays and then processing.,0
1656,"you should be using something like pdo or mysqli for this, but here's anexample with your current methods.",0
1658,"referencing a post variable that is not set will cause an error, so i'm checking to make sure that country is set then i'm provided a null answer to the switch.",0
1659,%5b and %5d are uri-encoded square brackets.,0
1660,this is a common way of sending multiple values for the same key to a server.,0
1661,"php parses it into an array, so in this case:",0
1662,"so in your code, $_post['content'] and $_post['content_attr'] should both be arrays.",0
1663,"the square brackets that you've used are unnecessary, but won't break anything.",0
1664,"you can probably do it, but you have to do it fully manually like so:",0
1665,i'd go for the latter as in the former you're likely to be writing your own serializer in the end :p - which is exactly why we have json.,0
1666,"you have missed from clause if you checked $mysqli-&gt;error you would have known it by yourself where id = 50,51,52 is not a valid mysql syntax you need to use in operator instead with prepared statements it will be evaluated as where id = '50,51,52' .",0
1667,that's it - an id column is compared with a single string.,0
1668,you will want to use explode() and a loop to do it properly.,0
1669,you will also need to use implode to generate the right number of question marks:,0
1670,"it seems you are checking the value of $v outside the foreach loop, which does not make sense -- $v is just one of the possibly many values in the array, so you can't use it to draw conclusions safely.",0
1671,of course that gets cumbersome if you want to check for a lot of possibilities.,0
1672,in that case you could use array_intersect and introduce some variables for readability:,0
1673,you're not checking the values in the array with the regular expressions.,0
1674,you can use trim() or specifically ltrim() to trim way the www.,0
1675,"also, we are sure that it should replace only from the first characters.",0
1676,"so, we need to use a preg_replace instead, making it replace from the start.",0
1677,"i'm just learning pdo, but i think you need to use bindvalue , not bindparam",0
1679,i found this in a comment on the php docs:,0
1682,"for instance, if the user doesn't input anything on the productname field of the form, then $productname will be set but empty .",0
1683,"so, you need check if it is empty() , and if it is, then insert null .",0
1684,"first of all, they are not ""fired at once"".",0
1685,that is just impossible by its nature - other then by total accident.,0
1686,i had the same issue using select * in mysqli.,0
1687,the issue lies with the bind_result part.,0
1688,normally you would need to add many variables.,0
1689,"meaning if you had about 20 columns, you would need 20 variables to include in the bind_result statement.",0
1690,you need to add variable witch will contain filename of image.,0
1691,"if you make done all and it will work when try to change code to use mysql i , read here http://php.net/manual/ru/book.mysqli.php",0
1694,"if you have a simple array, i would join all the elements together into a string and run it against is_numeric.",0
1695,at least you would only have to do the numeric check once.,0
1697,there could be various reasons for this to happen like scripts and iframes on your page.,0
1698,however from what you describe it sounds likely that link prefetching is the reason for what you observe.,0
1699,it is not possible to reliably check if a request is a prefetch request solely on the server side.,0
1700,"some browsers send an additional http request header when loading a prefetch, but you cannot rely on this.",0
1701,it's important to note that there are several layers to consider when making a database connection.,0
1702,"first you need to connect to the server, then you connect to your database of choice.",0
1703,once that's done then you can run your query.,0
1704,take a look at the php manual entry for mysqli_connect() http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysqli-connect.php,0
1705,"fred-ii pointed out that ""ci uses a different method as a prepared statement""looking back, i don't know how i lost track of that.",0
1706,"all of a suddent i was struggling mysqli statements outside of the codeigniter framework, and barking up the wrong tree.",0
1707,"offthebricks pointed out that ""it's not too surprising that there would be no mysqli errors after the mysqli_connect method is contructed because you never actually asked it to do anything.""",0
1708,you don't need to implode $temp_array if pmpro_hasmembershiplevel accepts array as its argument.,0
1711,"as per the docs , array_unique compares elements as strings by default.",0
1712,"this means your 2d array is being converted to an array of strings (all being ""array"" and generating the array-to-string notice) or which only one can be returned as unique.",0
1713,"a third alternative is to refactor the loop body as a function, then also call this function on the first row before entering the loop.",0
1714,you can use fputcsv as this function.,0
1715,best of all would be to use both mysqli_result::fetch_fields and fputcsv,0
1717,"there admittedly isn't much advantage to this, i just find the functional approach more interesting.",0
1718,it looks like you are missing session_start() at the beginning of both files.,0
1720,it is a good practice to have this call be the first thing in the file.,0
1721,say you have a variable $is_admin defined earlier in the code that gives someone admin abilities.,0
1722,if someone posts to that page with,0
1723,see your print_r section of second array it starts with index 1 and your $var assigned to 0.now here you are trying to access the 0th index.,0
1725,"it's weird to encode a var_dump into json, you should just be able to do:",0
1727,"you are sending a post parameter with the key ""select"" to the server in your ajax call:",0
1728,"in newtestx.php you are trying to retrieve the value from a post parameter with the key ""name"" - which doesn't exist:",0
1729,"inline javascript is considered bad practice and there's no need to echo out the html markup, it makes the mark up harder to work with.",0
1731,or you can change the function pullglobalsmarttags to return single dimension array and use str_replace as above.,0
1732,"you can even use the method you suggested, but it has much more replace in a loop.",0
1735,don't bother though... your code is incredibly insecure and wide open to sql injection attacks.,0
1736,"use prepared/parameterized queries with pdo or similar, or you will be hacked without doubt.",0
1738,you should also never assuming an upload succeeded.,0
1739,especially for a mysql dump file.,0
1740,"it is possible that the upload was truncated, yet you blindly feed the file back into mysql, which could leave you with a partially/totally trashed database.",0
1741,"you're close, however $fname in your html is empty (presuming you've submitted all relevant code).",0
1743,2) you're stored procedure expects 5 parameters so you need to pass 5 parameters.,0
1744,"if you don't know the values yet, pass either null or create another stored procedure.see this question for optional parameters for stored procedures: writing optional parameters within stored procedures in mysql?",0
1745,you dont need isset() and !empty() just use !empty() .,0
1746,you also dont need to mysql_string_escape() twice.,0
1747,it has nothing to do with md5() but you should change to sha1() anyway.,0
1748,a better approach would be to build your sql string up to reflect the data available.,0
1749,as you have sensibly named your $_post fields same as your database fields you can do something like this..,0
1750,this is all good for learning but if your code is going into production (as some of the commentators said) you should look to use a framework or library which will have solved all these problems for you and done a better job than i have above.,0
1751,if this doesnt work please update your post showing the contents of $_post by doing print_r($_post) at the top of your script.,0
1752,hard to debug until we have seen what is actually being sent in to the script.,0
1753,"a while loop doesn't create a new scope, as you can see here: http://codepad.org/h1u3wxzd about the code itself, here's a few suggestions:",0
1755,"it looks like you could fetch all the necessary information with a single query, something like:",0
1756,2) you should separate the code that gets data from the db from the code that constructs the html (?).,0
1758,3) i take it you are using the generated json to send it via ajax to a client.,0
1759,"in that case, i would totally cut the fat (eg: generated markup) and send only essentials (picture id, title, fname and whatever else is essential) and generate the code on the client side.",0
1760,this will make your page load faster and save you and your visitors bandwidth.,0
1762,id should be of numeric type.,0
1764,do you insert the value in html code -> use htmlspecialchars .,0
1765,do you plan on using it in subsequent queries?,0
1766,"in any case, the $_session should really store the original value imho (i.e.",0
1768,"just consider what would happen if you required the original (unescaped) id at some point, or have it escaped in a different way.",0
1769,it would be cumbersome to unescape the value that you have put in your $_session .,0
1775,"you can build the form like that, but when you submit it using post , that specific variable will be stored completely in $_post['date_month'] .",0
1776,"in your case, when you submit the form, you will find only the page variable in get (assuming there is no query string in $_server[""php_self""] ).",0
1777,"however, if you want the user to only provide the month in one way ( post or get ), you'd better use something like (written out for clarity):",0
1778,"also, you can try to run the same query in phpmyadmin to see if that works.",0
1779,"if it does, you're sure this is a problem with pdo.",0
1780,"if it doesn't, something must be wrong with the mysql server.",0
1781,but perhaps the easiest way to debug is to do something like this:,0
1782,this will give you more debug info.,0
1783,"when the query fails, the exception will be caught by the catch block, and the message will be outputted.",0
1784,this message usually tells you where the problem is.,0
1787,"at the beginning vs without it, you can add an extra check to your if clause;",0
1788,"when using mysqli, you have to add the connection string to your query.",0
1789,switch your calls in index.php to mysqli calls and make sure you're using a valid $conn .,0
1790,you would want to take just the for key-value pair and strip the for= part instead of just taking the full string.,0
1791,"for example, you could further the explode the string by = , check if the first part is for , and if so use the second part as the ip.",0
1792,"then also in the root folder, you'll have a filepage.php file that can handle the request.",0
1793,the full url that was requested will be passed into the $_get['q'] parameter.,0
1794,"you'll have to parse that parameter to be able to identify exactly which file was requested, something like this:",0
1795,"this was a little verbose, but i wanted to make sure all the steps were easily readable.",0
1796,"should be noted that this was written without the aid of a test environment, so it may contain errors.",0
1797,a non-persistent singelton connection (pdo) is getting closed at the end of the script (response).,0
1798,"persistent connections are not closed at the end of the script, but are cached and re-used when another script requests a connection using the same credentials.",0
1799,a persistent connection can cause unwanted side-effects and security issues.,0
1800,you can also omit that loop by using -&gt;fetchall() using the same flag:,0
1802,"for example, try making a hidden field in your form, and then have js on your option tags like:",0
1803,"that probably has issues with it.. you might have to play around but i hope you see what i am saying - use js to dynamically change the hidden input value to what you want, and then grab that value from the other side with php like:",0
1804,by this i assume you mean you are trying to go to the url:,0
1805,you can use $_request['qno'] and $_request['day'] to receive the variables both ways.,0
1806,"of course, your application has so many security holes i won't even touch.",0
1807,"phpsessid: this is is your php session id, this is fine preference=1; type=a: these are the cookies set by your code in the op because their the keys are set with plain text.",0
1808,preference[$id]=1; type[$id]=a: these keys cause the issue.,0
1809,"first of all, these seem to be duplicate of preference and type, put the bigger issue is that they have a [$id] in their names.",0
1811,"when you try to read the preference and type keys as strings to insert their values into the sql query string, you get the ""notice: array to string conversion"" message.",0
1812,"since we cannod debug your code, we cannot determine from where these duplicate and incorrect keys are coming from.",0
1813,my first guess is that these cookies are remnants of an earlier test.,0
1815,"if they reappear again, then you need to debug your code an establish where you set additional cookies.",0
1816,my other suggestion would be to check if you could use session or get parameters in the url instead of cookies for passing these variables.,0
1817,"also, your getsqlvaluestring() function automatically wraps ""text"" parameters with quotes, so you need to removes the quotes around the placeholders.",0
1818,place this at the top of your script (for development only),0
1823,"define the options you want to check for, then use in_array to check if one of them is used:",0
1824,"you're using the same names for each field in each row, so when you post the form, only the last is accessible.",0
1825,use array notation for the fields like this:,0
1826,this will give you an array for $_post['winner'] instead of a single value.,0
1827,do the same for the other &lt;input&gt; elements.,0
1828,"also, the code that processes the form after it's submitted only processes one value.",0
1829,you'll need to modify that to loop through these arrays.,0
1831,switch to mysqli_*() or pdo now.,0
1832,your code is susceptible to sql injection.,0
1833,"escape your input variables with mysql_real_escape_string() (or the mysqli equivalent) or better, switch to prepared statements.",0
1835,"i understand there are several ways this could be done including the responses shared by hobo and syed, as well as using javascript, but was really glad i could accomplish my goal with just php.",0
1836,"if the actual names of the input is operator_id , then you can't access it with $_get['operator_id'] , you have to use $_get['operator_id'] .",0
1838,so you're doing all the database code even if the if (isset($_get['operator_id']) is false.,0
1840,you can do this with mysql_num_rows() :,0
1842,they are no longer maintained and are officially deprecated .,0
1844,"if you choose pdo, here is a good tutorial .",0
1846,this would be avoided with use of pdo instead of mysql_ functions which are no longer maintained.,0
1847,query your table like this instead:,0
1849,so update your code with this:,0
1850,"you'd have to replace the filenames with underscores when you save them to the server, also.",0
1851,"since you don't have the code on where you save the files, you can urlencode() the link url so it will not be broken by hazardous characters.",0
1852,"note that originally it was broken by spaces because you didn't have the href value enclosed in quotes, which i'm doing here:",0
1854,i added a start of string anchor since you had an end of string one.. but it's hard to know if the regex will suit you without seeing your content.. this pattern assumes the only thing in the string is your date.,0
1855,"also fyi, this is just a simple verification.. it validates format but not if it's a real date.",0
1856,"if you want to validate it as a real date, you can explode at the / and then use checkdate",0
1860,"str_replace() doesn't modify the variable you pass in by parameter directly, it returns a new value, based on the function call.",0
1862,str_replace returns the stripped string - it does not work directly on parameter 3 (since the function signature of str_replace does not list any parameter as a reference),0
1863,"str_replace() returns a string , so you should initialize your variable to it again",0
1864,"it shows ""array"" because you need to iterate over the results, and not simply just echo it out.",0
1865,use var_dump or print_r and you should see the array; you can then loop out the results as you wish - var_dump will just show you the whole array.,0
1867,"as you already noticed this does not happen in the first iteration's unset, but in a following iteration.",0
1870,"as you can see, it does not need to use any key.",0
1871,"another option is that you reverse the children array and unset from the end, not the beginning.",0
1872,that way you don't pull the indexes under your feet:,0
1873,"but the self-reference is likely much more easy to use because it also works in other situations where you want to unset something in simplexml, so it's worth you take that well-explained read over there .",0
1874,"i would also say that the exit does not belong into that method, but i left it in so you can better orientate.",0
1875,instead the method should just do it's job to output the truncated xml and not care additionally about ending the script.,0
1876,move it out and place it after you call the method instead because that are two different kind of tasks: the one is xml processing and output and the other is to the program flow.,0
1877,$_server['http_host'] would contain port number as it is set in the host: header,0
1878,the variables get evaluated from right to left.,0
1879,the result of an assignment is the value being assigned.,0
1880,"in your example you are setting both $subject and $_post[""foldername""] to $foldername, which is unset.",0
1881,"because of the way that session_set_cookie_params works, it's expiry isn't updated on each page visit properly.",0
1883,"but note there is nothing like ""universal sanitization"".",0
1884,"let's call it just quoting , because that's what its all about.",0
1885,"mysql_real_escape_string($str) mysql_real_escape_string(addcslashes($str, ""%_"")) htmlspecialchars($str) json_encode() - only for utf8!",0
1887,{}')) - you cannot use preg_quote in this case because backslash would be escaped two times!,0
1888,if you use pdo (properly) you don't have to worry about mysql injection.,0
1891,"this will force the connection to be a mysqli class, and on the occasions it is not set, it will throw a fatal error closer to the source of the problem.",0
1892,"in the error output, it lists the possible values for ext_name.",0
1893,"there is mysqli and pdo_mysql , but not mysql .",0
1895,try taking that out and see if that works.,0
1897,it is common practice in mvc architecture to do so.,0
1898,should the class have methods for ide completition?,0
1899,"that is actually up to you, but common practice at workplaces where i worked was not to have them but make const string identifiers of the fields instead, which are then used to specifying the index in the global $_session variable through an object, such as your sessionmanager .",0
1900,it is a bloated formatting for var_dump.,0
1902,"if anyone is interested in this: i made 2 fields in the admin panel and the variable that was being sent to the database was ""field 1 + ' | ' + field 2"" and then i used explode to display the content on 2 sides, separator being "" | """,0
1904,in your case you should use bindvalue instead:,0
1905,or you can pass your array directly to execute() method:,0
1907,"so when execute runs, both :ctid and :p1 values are becoming equal to apple .",0
1908,"surely, this is not what you want)",0
1909,"then on your page that has your form, you can do something similar to:",0
1910,"then send the text to the server with any of the common methods, like setting the value of a hidden input element to be the image-data string.",0
1912,"by setting it to the src of any &lt;img&gt; , you'll find out how that it's a valid url that completely encodes the image, and you don't have to look hard to find ways to turn this encoding into anything else you might want, as it's fairly common standard",0
1917,"in order to call a function or class method, php has to evaluate all of its supplied parameters.",0
1918,"in order to call mysqli_fetch_row php will first evaluate its argument, that is $mysqli-&gt;query(""select id from users where id = $_post[uid]"") in order to call $mysqli-&gt;query php will first evaluate its argument, that is ""select id from users where id = $_post[uid]"" now php will pass the query string to $mysqli-&gt;query and return the result set (or error maybe) that return value will be passed to mysqli_fetch_row",0
1920,i realized there are some few typos in your code.,0
1921,you missed an opening bracket of the pdo constructor.,0
1922,the second one assigns a default value of 0 to $page .,0
1923,and the if statement will check first to see if $_get['page'] is set (to avoid warnings).,0
1925,"finally, $page = 0 simply sets a default value for $page .",0
1926,"if there is no value in $_get , $page will remain with a value of 0 .",0
1927,"this also ensures that $page is always set, if you're using it in code below your snippet.",0
1929,"when a cookie is set, it doesn't update $_cookie , so you can't access it immediately.",0
1930,it exists in $_cookie on the next page load.,0
1931,"or you can add it yourself, directly:",0
1933,at least sanitize and validate your inputs so your data will be as valid as you can.,0
1935,if you are using older version try installing ph5-mysql first.,0
1936,in your new page you would check $_get variable to see if the keys are set.,0
1937,firstname =somename&amp; lastname =somelastname so the keys you are looking for are firstname and lastname .,0
1938,you would have to check if the key is set in order to avoid getting undefined indexes.,0
1939,this checks if the key is set and if it is sets $firstname to the data from the url otherwise to null,0
1940,"since you are using mysqli you could take a different approach to your code, and use something like",0
1942,"$_session['username']; is not set, therefore you will get these notices and errors, the proper way to check would be:",0
1943,"if($_session['user_id']==$id) is specific to the blog owner, right?",0
1944,so you make this conditional check if the session id is in an array of acceptable id's.,0
1946,you pass the input name as an array and then you can access all checked boxes using the var itself which would then be an array.,0
1947,set the name in the form to meal_cat[] and you will be able to access all the checkboxes as an array.,0
1949,and if you want that data in the comma separated list then it try implode,0
1950,you can check at the time of insert into mysql db.,0
1951,"if a variable has been unset with unset(), it will no longer be set.",0
1954,and after that you can insert the $cval into the query for execution purpose.,0
1956,this immediately showed a missing field in the $_post variable (conf_email) which was then narrowed down to a missing '=' sign in this case.,0
1957,"i would split the query building into two phases and force an output there as well, and i would move it above the if ($match so that you can see the query always regardless of the logic:",0
1958,"i think it is better to write your logs to a file, instead of a database.",0
1960,you can show the user a nice error page by catching your errors.,0
1961,"you can redirect your users to your error page then, in case something went wrong.",0
1962,so this is just a suggestion as i have never tried this but after thinking about it a bit i think it would be an interesting option to explore.,0
1963,as i am fairly new to php &amp; pdo i'm sure there are other and better ways.,0
1964,this way you would avoid a db connection (which is the problem i guess) but still save the error.,0
1965,you would perhaps want to omit the echo'd text after die within the if statement.,0
1967,it does generate an error message.,0
1970,note the line i added to var_dump sub-objects.,0
1971,"the error you were initially getting was that the elements of your sets array were also objects, not strings as expected.",0
1972,"if you only need to access certain elements of the set objects, you can access them using $val->property.",0
1973,the problem is that if the value has an apostrophe this happens:,0
1974,that way the apostrophe's get encoded and will be editable in your form,0
1975,simply use mysqli's prepared statements and you will be fine.,0
1977,"even better is to filter the input to only what you need, and save only the filtered input to your database.",0
1979,i don't know if i understood correctly but maybe you want to do it like this:,0
1981,no matter on which position in array.,0
1983,"you're sending it the string ""1,2,3"" , which it doesn't understand.",0
1984,"if you just need to know if two arrays' values are exactly the same (regardless of keys and order), then instead of using array_diff, this is a simple method:",0
1985,the above code will rewrite an url such as www.examp.le/foobar123/ to www.examp.le/index.php?target=foobar123 .,0
1986,you can then use the $_get variable to read the value of $_get['target'] .,0
1987,"it will contain the leading slash, i.e.",0
1988,"/dnd5je from your example, which you can easily remove.",0
1990,"point is, your php doesn't have to be a continuous block, you can close your php tag at any time, resume using regular html, and then open a new php tag and continue in your loop.",0
1993,"you can't write a if statement in a array declaration, but what you could do is to use a ternary operator like this:",0
1994,where it push's one or more elements to the end of your array,0
1995,you can get error messages from form using one of these:,0
1996,first check if the request is post in your action,0
1997,"it is not possible to run multiple php scripts in parallel for a single session, because this would lead to unexpected behaviour when using session variables.",0
1998,"your problem is that you are submitting your form for the specific page login-process.php from there if it is everything right you redirect that page to the index page here: header(""location:../index.php""); .",0
1999,the problem is that when you do that you loose all variables created at that time.,0
2000,"php works in a request context so, you submit your login it get processed then you redirect it (it is like you have submitted again).",0
2001,with your current code you can solve it in two ways,0
2002,"1 - either send your form to the index.php ( &lt;form class=""login-form"" method=""post""&gt; if you don't add the action it will submit to the same page, therefore login.php) as it already require the login_process.php code but you will have to remove that redirect ( header(""location:../index.php""); ) and add some control variables to show the actual index page and not the login form again.",0
2006,"my development environment has a rather distinct path structure so this works well, and i don't need to worry if additional domains are added to $_server[http_host] , or a client that provides an incorrect http_host value (although that would be rare ...).",0
2007,why the addslashes() and htmlentities() ?,0
2009,"first off, more than three parameters in the constructor and most of them are not required straight away if you introduce a separate validate() method.",0
2010,"now, the dependency on $notice and the other two arguments are local to only the validate() method.",0
2012,first of all you can safely remove the following statements.,0
2013,the parameters are already escaped by pdo.,0
2014,you don't have to do it using obsolete methods.,0
2016,thirdly i suggest you echo $e-&gt;getmessage() in your catch block to see if there is any exception thrown.,0
2017,"when you click your (x) mark to delete/remove product from cart, at that time you can get that product's array key.",0
2018,now you know that this key is unique as (i hope you are using the same key to store that products data in all arrays) in all other arrays i.e.,0
2019,"id , pwidth , etc.., you can unset($key) that key from all the arrays and than can do array_values($array) to reindex the arrays.",0
2020,"and of course, you need to move your getcompanies call outside of the loop.",0
2022,* and are going to be removed from the language soon.,0
2024,there's nothing special whatsoever about post requests and sessions.,0
2026,"at the beginning of your document, this will start the session engine and enable you to set session variables (ie.",0
2027,if you're wanting to get values from a $_post you could relate the two together by :,0
2028,i also encountered the same problem recently.,0
2029,i could not access the contents of the $_session variable.,0
2031,the problen is that you are using $n=$_get['n']; but the method you are using is post,0
2033,the function.pdoconnect.php is where your database credentials are populated:,0
2034,"first of all, don't check with isset.",0
2035,since $_post is always generated you should be using !empty().,0
2036,"and you are having issues because you don't have table variable set, $table_name needs to be defined.",0
2037,if you are inserting questions to a table named 'questions' simply change your sql to:,0
2038,you're on the right track yes.,0
2039,however you need to make a couple changes.,0
2042,"no problem if you use tinyint, but i prefer enum to determine user access because it direcly shows the user access.",0
2043,"not just number and i must remember again what mean of 1,2,3, or whatever.",0
2045,you can use an array of allowed column names to sanitize the query.,0
2046,"that'll occur when there is no element p in the array $_get , because despite the fact that you went to the trouble of creating $page to cover this case, you go on to use $_get['p'] everywhere instead anyway.",0
2047,like lucia angermüller suggested you could do something like this,0
2049,as pointed out by @mrcode getjson() just does a get request.,0
2050,so i changed the way to access the parameter in the php code from $_post to $_get .,0
2051,"the other option would be to leave the post request in place, which would change the client side js to",0
2052,"finnally i use the str_replace and displays both videos.here's is my code , maybe will help someone in the future",0
2053,"another way to do it is in javascript, there might be some scenarios where $_get['id'] is set but the actual image is missing.",0
2054,"however, in order for your code completely to work the way you want it, here what i would do.",0
2055,the following control i think was creating the biggest confusion in your code:,0
2057,here is an example using $_get .,0
2058,you can however use $_post and would need to make both directives match in both files in order to work properly.,0
2059,you can also check if a color was chosen.,0
2060,"if none are chosen, then a seperate message will appear.",0
2061,get requests can be cached get requests remain in the browser history get requests can be bookmarked get requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data get requests have length restrictions get requests should be used only to retrieve data,0
2063,if you want to turn specific values in to new variables if they have been selected:,0
2064,"first off, since you explicitly put datatype: ""json"" , you do not need json.parse .",0
2066,"sidenote: i suggest use $result = $stmt-&gt;fetchall(pdo::fetch_assoc); , since you really don't need to values in numeric indices.",0
2068,"what is important here is that the value of $column can never be something else than what is specified, namely either 'column1' or 'default_column' , no matter what the input is.",0
2070,"i would advice to check the other url parameters as well, if only to prevent unexpected errors.",0
2072,"if you're not going to have repeat prices, use the price as the key of the array.",0
2073,"if you will have repeat prices, you could probably use array_walk or array_multisort.",0
2074,"to find which radio button was selected you need to look at the value of $_request['color'] because you have called the radio button set name=""color""",0
2075,"so you need to put a unique value into the value="""" attribute for each radio button",0
2076,now in your php you can access which radiobutton was selected using $_request['color'],0
2077,first things first: do you have any data at all on the device that you're using?,0
2078,i've made that mistake: try to get data from an account with no google fit data at all.,0
2082,i highly suggest getting familiar with creating forms in html and usage of $_post since it is relevant to what you're doing.,0
2084,it looks like somehow your header is getting sent no matter what.,0
2085,"without looking at the rest of your code i cannot be sure, but print_r , echo , or any other type of output before the header would cause it to not be sent.",0
2087,i would advise to use one of these:,0
2088,so the easiest (from a procedural re-factoring perspective) is to use mysqli_*() functions and use mysqli_real_escape_string() .,0
2089,"note: use &lt;textarea&gt; , if you use input and press enter then form will get submitted.",0
2090,the name attribute in a radio input specifies it's radio group.,0
2091,"therefore, when you try to submit the form, it sends both values.",0
2092,"specify the name attribute of both to something like gender , and it would work.",0
2093,"and in the php portion, you just need to request that value once, so do it with: $gender = mysqli_real_escape_string($con, $_post['gender']);",0
2094,once you read up on php's pdo you can rewrite your code like this,0
2096,"in your example you search for ""xml"" but the first output shows that there is not ""xml"" in your string.",0
2097,when you echo false it shows nothing.,0
2098,thus you can't see the result.,0
2100,the file is utf-16 and not utf-8 encoded.,0
2101,"let's see the string "" xml "" in the different encodings:",0
2102,"fundamentally you're just experiencing here that strings in php are binary and when you output them to the browser, the browser does hide some characters, here the nul characters of which there are many in the file.",0
2105,"you are posting to test2.php , so only test2.php will receive the $_post , not the first page!",0
2106,"if you call var_dump($_post) on the second page, you should see the variables being sent.",0
2107,but $_post will be empty when the form is displayed on the first page (i.e.,0
2109,you could however change the structure a bit to support this.,0
2111,you can still loop over the values as you can turn this whole thing in an associative array by passing true to json_decode as a second parameter.,0
2112,"i for one am not a big fan of my own answer, and would probably just loop the thing, but it may still answer your question.",0
2113,"i assume you are using pdo, then you have to connect to the database first:",0
2114,it's not returning the index joe because the value 21 is in the first array.,0
2115,it does store the boolean value.,0
2116,so when you get the value you should expect a boolean value.,0
2117,if you use var_dump($a) instead of print_r you will see that it is stored perfectly as,0
2118,the name attribute in &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt; define what name the field has.,0
2119,the data of the fields is then sent to the server with the corresponding name.,0
2121,you need to install a package which contains the mysql or mysqli php extensions (preferably mysqli).,0
2122,"starting with version 4.0.7, phpmyadmin shows a proper error message for this situation, see https://sourceforge.net/p/phpmyadmin/bugs/3997/ .",0
2124,"if you also need to increment other columns such as videos , do the same thing i did for the credits .",0
2126,"remember that, if you are using linux, file names are case-sensitive.",0
2127,use the file_exists() function to check this:,0
2128,"the undefined index notice, means that the index 'state' &amp;&amp; 'area' does not exist in your $_post array.",0
2129,this usaually means the data from the form isnt being sent properly.,0
2130,try doing a var_dump($_post); see if that brings up any data and check if that names are there,0
2131,"as you can see, in the in the values are unquoted, so they're interpreted as field names.",0
2132,you need to add quotes around each value in the in .,0
2133,"you can fix it by looping, and adding quotes around each value:",0
2135,"with meekro you cannot get typed results, as it is not using prepared statements - the only way to get the data type right off the fetch.",0
2136,"with pdo, it is possible only if pdo is built upon mysqlnd and emulation mode is turned off .",0
2137,"having there prerequisites, you can have your results already in corresponding types",0
2138,also try printing $_post and $_session arrays so that you can come to know whether all parameters are passing/ passing correctly and all the sessions are setting up properly.,0
2139,"that is because.. when the if fails which means the $_post['sub'] is not set , so when it comes to the else part , you are trying to output $_post['sub'] which was actually not set ( which is actual source of this problem )",0
2140,"i don't know what your form looks like, but basically php tells you there is no $_post['month'] .",0
2141,what you really should do is start debugging.,0
2142,see what is in $_post and what is not.,0
2144,you assign a normal string to $days and overwrite it on each iteration.,0
2145,"you could append to it, by using the .= operator.",0
2147,"$day ), but maybe easier is to use implode :",0
2148,note there is a small functional difference.,0
2149,"implode will add spaces inbetween the days, while the foreach loop will also put a space at the start.",0
2153,if you want to make it general you can check $_request variable.,0
2157,you are opening your self up to the biggest types of sql injection attacks possible.,0
2158,in addition your form variables need to be called from within the $_post[] array.,0
2159,so you would need to call the variables as $_post['firstname'] instead of $firstname .,0
2164,however if you're using mysqli i would recommend using the object orientated syntax over the procedural.,0
2165,that way you don't have to parse the $connection variable each time you query.,0
2166,"also, you don't have to close the connection every time when you're done querying.",0
2167,its done automatically at the end of the script and without it it can continue to use the already opened connection.,0
2170,there is no need to build a string of images and then explode that string into an array of images instead just add the images directly to an array as radu mentioned.,0
2171,if you do the preg_replace on the full string you only need to make one regex call.,0
2172,then instead of explode and implode i use str_replace to add the li tags.,0
2175,this means i can use $1 and $2 in the regex replace.,0
2177,in your html you can have your checkboxes like this (considering you are storing ids of some sort),0
2178,on you php side you can use function implode to form ids into a string as shown below (considering you are doing a post),0
2179,where you read from the database you can transform the value from db to an array like this,0
2181,here's a solution that replaces a lot of your code and uses pdo library (instead of mysql_).,0
2183,"it really does replace a lot so, if i took out some functionality that i shouldn't let me know and i'll slip it back in.",0
2185,you might want to test this by using the second script and visiting the ajax page directly in your browser.,0
2186,"after testing, be sure to remove any unnecessary print/echo/var_dump statements.",0
2187,"almost, array_chunk() makes multiple pieces instead you want to slice the array in two pieces by a given key, this can be done with array_slice()",0
2188,for the types you can also implode them into strings and feed them into mysqli_stmt_bind_param .,0
2189,there's no evidence of any of the code you posted of anything that actually connects to the database (a mysql_connect() call).,0
2190,without that i can only assume you've not connected to the database.,0
2191,you can't execute queries if you're not connected.,0
2192,however i won't show you how to fix this because you're using deprecated mysql_* functions in your code.,0
2195,"so i second jamwaffles comment to use print_r , i myself prefer print_r unless i really want to get picky on the types of the values.",0
2196,and to be sure the user really hits the button you can also add this,0
2197,"if you face such problem in the future, it is a good practice to var_dump the results like:",0
2198,"no, you should not create multiple instances of pdo in that case.",0
2199,just create 1 instance and use pdo::query() on it.,0
2201,you can find an example in the documentation for pdo::prepare() .,0
2202,"yes, you initially connect to the database by creating an instance of the pdo object.",0
2203,but you use this object to run queries with and the results are packed into another class.,0
2204,"so you mainly have several classes with your query results, but just one connection to the database which runs the queries.",0
2205,the pdo object stores the connection in which the queries are carried out.,0
2206,"normally, you only need one of those.",0
2207,"while there are cases where 2 connections might be convinient (when connecting to entirely different databases for instance), you generally only need one instance of the pdo class.",0
2208,"what you will have multiple instances of, is the pdostatement class.",0
2209,which stores the query statements themselves (as well as the results).,0
2213,in this way you can keep users from accessing other clients' subdomains.,0
2214,"if you want to get fancy, you could do something like use session_set_cookie_params so the same phpsessid cookie could be accessible to all domains and subdomains.",0
2215,this has its benefits especially if your centralized log-in page needs to detect if the user is logged-in for a particular domain or subdomain.,0
2217,"never trust the session id being sent, even if the cookie is tied to a specific subdomain, since the sessions for all subdomains are being stored in the same directory on the server.",0
2218,"a solution for this might be: ini_set(session.save_path, ""/path/to/your/folder/$clientid"") then you'd have a unique directory dedicated for each client for storing sessions.",0
2219,the benefit of this approach is that your $_session won't contain information related to another subdomain.,0
2221,client2=8d72edf35377a27388cb;client8=b47277bc8e3d4a5f then php can read this cookie and know the client the session exists for.,0
2224,"based on your code, it looks like $this-&gt;input-&gt;ip_address() has the possibility of returning '0.0.0.0' if the ip is not valid or could not be determined.",0
2225,"however, your comments also state that you need to record the ip address even if the above method returns '0.0.0.0'.",0
2226,"first, i'd recommend checking to see if $this-&gt;input-&gt;ip_address() and $this-&gt;valid_ip() are working as expected.",0
2227,is $this-&gt;valid_ip() returning false for ip's that should be considered valid?,0
2228,"second, i'd update your code to always fall back to $_server['remote_addr'] if $this-&gt;input-&gt;ip_address() returns '0.0.0.0'.",0
2229,"or if you wanted, you could not use $this-&gt;input-&gt;ip_address() and do as @rockerest suggests and just use $_server['remote_addr'] to being with.",0
2230,this is how to open the connection to the database using mysqli :,0
2231,"i don't know the exact structure of your search table, so it is possible you will have to adapt the above code to match your actual field names.",0
2233,"also notice that a non empty $where will always begin with "" and"".",0
2234,"this makes it simpler to compose the clause dynamically, but requires a first condition our $where can be appended to.",0
2235,"the ""1"" in the query is an always true condition to which we can append our $where and be syntactically correct.",0
2240,"in short, it depends if you want to send a utf-8 email, or an ascii email .",0
2241,"ascii email - you'll need to do a html 4.01 entity swap out (which is the default), but with the same ent_disallowed flag:",0
2242,this will swap out as many entities as possible to make sure things like &eacute; are represented in ascii (as &amp;eacute ;).,0
2243,this part depends entirely on your audience and the kinds of email clients you're expecting to interact with.,0
2245,if you're going for broad coverage with older clients then sending an ascii email is a safer bet.,0
2246,that means you'll need to convert all of the unicode code points which are out of range of ascii into an ascii compatible representation (html entities).,0
2247,fundamentally this is targeting older clients so using ent_html5 - the greatly expanded entities set - makes no sense here.,0
2248,"however here's the other issue - the older html 4.01 entity set represents far fewer unicode codepoints, so if you're expecting to send text in a broad range of languages then you'll most likely need to send a utf-8 email instead.",0
2250,"this isn't a good idea, since depending on other circumstances, this can lead to bugs.",0
2251,what you want your logic to look like is this:,0
2255,you can use bind_param from mysqli to accomplish this.,0
2257,then you can get the value you want with $row[$_post['colour']],0
2258,due to dependency injection you should pass the pdo connection as a constructor parameter.,0
2260,"you can use libraries such as mockery, prophecy or phpunit mock objects.",0
2261,then this is not a model but a provider or repository.,0
2262,so you should call it userprovider or userrepository,0
2263,the best you can do is put all your post variables to a session like this:,0
2264,"when situating the header('location: page2.php'); in a if condition, etc.",0
2265,make sure that it will be in the first php script of the page and above any html output.,0
2271,"php does the necessary change, sends the page to the browser, and forgets about all your variables.",0
2272,"if you need this data to be retained across requests, there are several possibilities:",0
2274,"if on the other hand, it must be a global setting, the same for every user, then you should look to file storage , or to a database , like mysql.",0
2276,you can apply array_values to print the value based unique array,0
2278,risking your live data by exposing it to your test code is a very bad idea.,0
2279,"in this test got you the exact opposite of what you meant to do (read it as ""not""), removing it should help.",0
2280,"it's also good practice to output something in your ajax query, so you can get some feedback from the server in your browser dev tools.",0
2282,update : also removed a test to accomodate an array-typed $_post['params'] .,0
2283,check if you have any answer in both arrays.,0
2284,"if you don't, check your database field name and your post field/input (both are case-sensitive)",0
2286,edit: this code is broken as of june 2016. see this answer for explanation and potential workaround.,0
2287,the same technology mentioned in the previous link was added to associates' login.,0
2288,"i wrote this code up and it works well for me, in the last var_dump i see all my account info and things like that.",0
2289,"if you don't delete the cookies, you can make subsequent curl requests to protected pages with your login.",0
2290,hopefully this can help you learn about how to do it.,0
2291,"a lot of times on big sites you need to visit the login page to get cookies set, and also they usually have csrf tokens on the forms you need to submit with them.",0
2292,"really does suggest you should use sphinxql, not the sphinxapi.",0
2293,starting a new project with sphinxapi is not recommended.,0
2294,"there is not special client to use sphinxql, you just use any ol' mysql-client.",0
2297,"a silly example, perhaps ... but consider something like this:",0
2300,"i don't know if it fits here, but i've used unset() with $_session variables...",0
2301,"don't use double quotes in sql queries, they don't work.",0
2302,"don't store display logic/styling in your database, you'll have one helluva time trying to change the color from green to notgreen in the future.",0
2303,"hell, that should be in a stylesheet, not inline.",0
2305,"learn pdo or mysqli, you're doing yourself a disservice by not doing so.",0
2306,your data needs to be properly escaped and/or paramterized.,0
2308,"so the [, is saying you could, but don't have to do array_slice($array, $offset, $length) the $length parameter is optional.",0
2312,"so for example, if $_session['string3'] is ""abc"", php will echo the value inside the js and you'll get this:",0
2313,you are passing the job id parameter as id .,0
2314,"however, when fetching the id for the specific job, you're retrieving job_id out of the $_get superglobal.",0
2315,$_get['id'] instead of $_get['job_id'] should work.,0
2316,"you're mixing mysql apis using mysql_real_escape_string() while being connected using pdo, so you can't use those together while connecting/querying for the same code.",0
2321,looks like array_unshift cannot do what you want.,0
2322,you can use one of the array_merge solutions some people already mentioned or you can use the + operator for arrays:,0
2325,"general, smarty's pipe '|' operator use the value before the pipe as the first argument for the called function, which is the search text in case of str_replace.",0
2326,"when you refresh the browser it is the browser that remembers the contents of the form and resubmits it, the php program runs from the start again, and php populates $_post with a fresh copy of the data.",0
2327,use the post-redirect-get pattern to avoid the data being resubmitted.,0
2328,"your str_replace change your $_get value, so you should remove these lines:",0
2329,"and you can use urlencode() to receive your url paramter with special characters, so your code should be:",0
2330,"move $_session[""timelogged""] = time() - $_session[""logintime""]; to your 1.php script.",0
2333,"you can leave it up to pdo to determine the type you know, you don't have to be explicit",0
2335,here's a solution (i assumed that $post['test_email'] has to be equal to $row1['test_email'] .,0
2337,"i'm using a shorthand if...else here, but you could also use a classic if :",0
2340,it looks like you are using pdo already.,0
2341,as far as the first one i'm betting that the html isn't quite right after the jquery insert based on the fact that the var_dump on the $_post is empty.,0
2343,so if your html is like this:,0
2344,i'm not sure what i was thinking.,0
2345,the $_post['checkme'] array won't match the rest of the line.,0
2346,it isn't added to the $_post array if it's not checked.,0
2348,key will be zero because it isn't added to that array unless it's checked so it will be the first item in the $_post['checkme'] array.,0
2351,depending on your exact needs you can use: next value for,0
2353,rdb$database is guaranteed to contain only one row (like oracle's dual).,0
2354,"so you need select next value for gen_main from rdb$database or select gen_id(gen_main, 1) from rdb$database to get the next sequence value.",0
2355,"in general however i would advise you to add a trigger to do the auto-increment for you, see firebird generator guide for details.",0
2356,you can then use insert ... returning &lt;column-list&gt; to retrieve the generated id.,0
2357,you can get user datas and save it to $_session and get them from session.,0
2358,if session is not created before you can get them from database and save it to $_session .,0
2360,"if you are calling this function more than once (or other functions also need a connection), then move the $con - mysqli_connect() and $con-&gt;close(); operations outside of the function, to a higher scope.",0
2361,"usually either at the start of the entire script, if you will almost always need a connection, or at the point in the script, at the point it's determined that a database connection will actually be needed.",0
2362,"while you're at it, you might want to consider closing up some sql injection vulnerabilities.",0
2363,"including ""unsafe"" variables in sql text can be an issue.",0
2364,its secure and easy to use.,0
2365,here's something you could do to store it as a session.,0
2366,"instead replace session variables with normal variables and you could call to this each time without using session variables.either way its possible, but session method would not call database each and every time after its initialized this way.",0
2367,"that will redirect the browser to example.com, note that you can only use this if output has not already been sent to the browser, e.g make sure you have echo , print or var_dump statements before you use header()",0
2368,"if you did get past the id check, it looks like you are putting data into $_session before they delete the app, and then not re-checking it.",0
2369,"once you have it in the $_session , if you don't go back to facebook to verify, there is no reason an exception would be thrown.",0
2371,you probably need to re-factor your code a little.,0
2372,write out the steps on paper; that helps me.,0
2373,"you want to check a username is unique on form submission if it's not, generate a new username",0
2374,"first of all, reading another user's session data is a horrible idea.",0
2375,if you need to have shared access to that data - don't store it in the session.,0
2377,"there's no easy/reliable way to read session data without intercepting it, but that's not by accident, it's exactly because you shouldn't do it.",0
2379,so the main problem in your case is not a special character its how you work with your data.,0
2380,so you shouldn't use a path given by a user because the user can manipulate the path or other variables.,0
2382,and mysql interprets the unquoted string scqf07 as a column name.,0
2384,"this is usually done within a while loop, like so:",0
2385,"you can use in_array function of php , look at this link http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php",0
2386,you will have to use in_array() function to search whether input provided matches with list of keyword specified by you.,0
2389,"it should be == instead of = ; however, this does not answer your question.",0
2390,"if i understand correctly, you simply want to redirect the user based on a keyword they entered.",0
2391,i would recommend updating your keywords array to have the keywords and the urls you want to redirect the user to all-in-one:,0
2392,"if all of the keywords go to the same url, you can either set them all to the same url in the $product1_keywords array - or - you can use php's in_array() method for a quicker lookup:",0
2393,the array_unique function will do this for you.,0
2394,you just needed to add the sort_regular flag:,0
2395,to remove duplicate values then we can use array_unique() function.,0
2396,the functionality of it is to accept an array and returns another array without duplicate values.,0
2397,"also, your code is susceptible to sql injection.",0
2398,you should escape any user input that is going to be used in a sql query.,0
2399,"try wrapping mysql_escape_string($_post['value']) around all $_post , $_get , and $_request input.",0
2401,just use some pdo or mysqli mysql_ extension was deprecated in php 5.5.0,0
2402,"if you have magic_quotes_gpc on in your php configuration (it's on by default in php &lt; 5.4), you need to call stripslashes on any variables in $_post or $_get .",0
2404,you actually will need to read the input from php://input,0
2406,naturally it gives this error when you upload two pictures - $file_type2 is for the third picture which is not there.,0
2408,as i see it you don't need any foreach - just put your database file names together as you show it above.,0
2409,i though have one suggestion: use basename($_files['file_upload_int']['name']) for the filename.,0
2410,this way you don't overwrite the file ending with jgp even it is a png .,0
2413,one idea that did occur was that of a proxy object.,0
2414,"it implements the same interface(s) as the actual object you want to pass in, but instead of implementing anything it just holds an instance of the real class and forwards method calls on to it.",0
2415,"because the proxy has the same interface as the real class, you can pass it as an argument to any function/method that type hints for the interface.",0
2417,"however, the real class doesn't get instantiated unless a message actually gets sent to the proxy, which does lazy instantiation of the real class behind the scenes.",0
2418,"there is an extra layer of indirection involved with the proxy object, which obviously means that there is a small performance hit for every method call you make.",0
2419,"however, it does allow you to do lazy instantiation, so you can avoid instantiating classes you don't need.",0
2420,whether this is worth it depends on the cost of instantiating the real object versus the cost of the extra layer of indirection.,0
2421,edit: i had originally written this answer with the idea of subclassing the real object so you could use the technique with objects that don't implement any interfaces such as pdo.,0
2423,on reflection that was a big mistake so i've updated the answer to reflect what i should have done in the first place.,0
2425,"you'll have to wrap such classes in another class that does provide an interface for the proxy approach to be viable, meaning yet another layer of indirection.",0
2426,if you want to implement lazy loading you basically have two way to do it (as you have already written in the topic):,0
2427,"instead of injecting an instance of object you might need, you inject a factory or a builder .",0
2428,"the difference between them is that instance of builder is made for returning one type of object (maybe with different setups), while factory makes different types of instances ( with same lifetime and/or implementing same interface ).",0
2430,that would look something like this:,0
2433,"this, for example, lets you have a single connection for all the objects which where created by said factory, and the connection is create only, when you first time ask an instance from factory .",0
2434,"the other way to combine both methods (which i have not used, though) would be to create full blow provider class, which in constructor accepts an anonymous function.",0
2435,"then the factory could pass around this same instance of provider and the expensive object (phpexcel, doctrine, swiftmailer or some other instance) is only created once a product from that factory first time turns to the provider (couldn't come up with better name to describe all objects created by same factory) and requests it.",0
2436,"after that, this expensive object is shared between all products of factory .",0
2439,so what you have to do is give that column another name that is a valid php variables name using this syntax select max(employee_id) as max_empid which renames the column to max_empid,0
2440,i am assuming nothing so i will also include a connection to the database in my answer.,0
2441,"you will need to replace the my_user , my_password and my_db values, or ignore the connection if you have already dont that somewhere else.",0
2442,"i have also used the object oriented approach to mysqli, if you are using the proceedural calls, you may have to amend the code accordingly",0
2444,you can check the manual for more error codes.,0
2445,i don’t know why it doesn’t contain the expected value.,0
2446,"but try $_server['http_host'] instead, that contains the value provided by the client in the http header field host .",0
2447,but see chris shiftlett’s server_name versus http_host for security considerations.,0
2448,you are trying to get first name from login page html form.,0
2449,but i don't remember if any login page ever have first name field.,0
2450,so you should get first name from database and put it in $_session['firstname'],0
2451,"in the code you posted, mysql_real_escape_string is used to encode(=escape) user inputs.",0
2452,"the code is therefore correct, i.e.",0
2453,does not allow any sql injection attacks.,0
2454,note that it's very easy to forget the call to mysql_real_escape_string - and one time is enough for a skilled attacker!,0
2455,"therefore, you may want to use the modern pdo with prepared statements instead of adodb.",0
2466,"as others have noted, the most likely cause is a character encoding mismatch.",0
2467,"since the titles you're trying to convert are apparently in utf-8, the problem is most likely that your php source code isn't .",0
2468,"try re-saving the file as utf-8 text, and see if that fixes the problem.",0
2469,"btw, a simple way to debug this would be to print out both your data rows and your transliteration array into the same output file using e.g.",0
2470,"print_r() or var_dump() , and look at the output to see if the non-ascii characters in it look correct.",0
2471,"if the characters look right in the data but wrong in the transliteration table (or vice versa), that's a sign that the encodings don't match.",0
2472,"if you have the php iconv extension installed (and you probably do), consider using it to automatically convert your titles to ascii.",0
2474,there are better alternatives likes mysqli or pdo,0
2475,with single query you can fix your issue like this,0
2476,"after sorting your array, use array_unshift() to prepend elements to the beginning of the array.",0
2477,your form will need a method.,0
2479,"i'd suggested adding method='post' as an attribute to your &lt;form&gt; as a first step, as all the $_post variables you're referring to currently wouldn't contain anything, if that is an accurate copy/paste of your html form code.",0
2484,you are not closing the string on the echo after your query:,0
2486,i realize this is for practice but it should be mentioned that this methodology is highly vulnerable to sql injection and will make your database easily accessible.,0
2487,"you could, instead, use php's pdo library for your connections or at the very least sanitize your inputs .",0
2490,you will get an array of rows where domain is 'mydomain'also you can do:,0
2491,ps: i think you don't need mysql_both.,0
2494,"$_post only contains the filename, $_files contains the actual file.",0
2495,"additionally, zend_mime_part::type expects an mime type, i.e.",0
2496,$attachments-&gt;type needs to be an mime type.,0
2497,for text files this is text/plain .,0
2498,i also don't think you can set an empty filename.,0
2499,you don't need a loop for this.,0
2500,"use array_search() to find the key of the most repeated value, and use chr() on it:",0
2501,another way to achieve the same is to use in_array function:,0
2502,"so, this will check, if $_post is not set, load home.php else, if it is set then continue",0
2504,"please note that array_merge() (contrary to array_push() , gotta love the consistency) does not alter the array passed as its first argument, so you'll have to store the return value which i do on the first line ( $array = ... ).",0
2507,you need to check the actual form elements (inputs) to see if data is sent.,0
2508,you should be checking the actual values in the likes of $_post['title'] to see if data has been sent from the form.,0
2512,second don't use success/error callback in jquery is too deprecated.,0
2513,i understand that you want update row in html table data from the server ?in success callback simply update the table using jquery text method for jquery object.,0
2514,you don't paste all code so i write example:,0
2515,you should set the name attribute of all your selects something like productcode[] (with the brackets).,0
2516,php will automatically create you an $_post['productcode'] variable containing all the values in an array..,0
2518,(make sure the string you're sending is the sql statement you want to execute.),0
2520,values incorporated into the text of a sql statement must be properly escaped.,0
2521,but that's not sufficient to guarantee that code isn't still vulnerable to sql injection.,0
2526,your saying that you want fresh content without a page refresh .,0
2529,"if you have it in included file, it's init after using in condition.",0
2530,"or you can check if it exist with isset , as captain crunch said.",0
2531,"unfortunately, some versions of pdo don't know how to use a named parameter multiple times in the same query.",0
2532,"if i recall, this bug is fixed in newer versions, but you may be stuck using an older version of php with pdo.",0
2533,"ps: not related to your question about using prepared statements, but your use of '%pattern%' for full-text search is thousands of times slower than using any fulltext index solution .",0
2535,"either enable exception mode, or else check the return values for false :",0
2537,you should actually be appending the results into $days like this:,0
2538,"i'm not a php developer, so this may not work, but you may be able to do this using oci_fetch_all and array_map , like this:",0
2539,i've shown both instances of this below on how to set a cookie and session.,0
2540,you can refresh just 2.php and the cookie output should still show the value of $_cookie['name'] .,0
2542,firstly i have to call the page this way: index.php?image_src=xy then i need to use $_get insted of $_cookie .finally with this way the sessions are unnecessary.,0
2543,(here i just use preg_match_all() to get all numbers from your string.,0
2544,after this i use end() to get the last number from the string and then i simply use str_replace() to replace the old number with the incremented one),0
2546,"that being said, cakephp 1.3 doesn't use pdo, but the (also already deprecated, and as of php 7 completely removed) mysql extension, ie php_mysql.dll .",0
2549,you are mixing mysqli_* functions with the deprecated mysql_* functions.,0
2553,"for instance, array_key_exists(""fr"", $row) will return true if $row contains an fr key.",0
2554,if you want to see all the keys (i.e.,0
2555,"all the columns), simply use array_keys ; for example : array_keys($row) will give you all the keys in $row .",0
2558,it may be as simple as whitespace/newline characters breaking your url.,0
2559,"the thing is that 2var.php is already a php script, and it so happens that you don't actually need rewriteengine for this.",0
2560,"if you try to visit your script with rewriteengine and its rules disabled, it will work, but produce warning about undefined index: var1 .",0
2562,this means that you can put 2var in any directory on the server and it will still work.,0
2563,"also, i noticed you link to &lt;a href=""2var.php?var1=one&amp;var2=two""&gt; .",0
2564,"the point of having rewrite rules is to make urls pretty, so you can directly link to &lt;a href=""2var.php/one/two""&gt; instead (or any other syntax you desire).",0
2566,"check the return value from $stmt-&gt;execute() , if there was a problem it will return false and you should check $stmt-&gt;errorinfo() for details.",0
2567,you should check error status from both pdo::prepare() and pdostatement::execute() every time you call them.,0

2573,"this is a mixture of how php handles files, and you not following the cakephp conventions, causing cakephp to ""overwrite"" your other form data.",0
2574,"you should use the form helper, that way you would avoid the problem in the first place, unless of course you'd fiddle with the field names and use such clashing ones again.",0
2575,"and the rest of the form data in $_post using the same key, ie",0
2576,"notice the keys and the strings are quoted and the [ ] around $temp to make it an array, for the second part i convert array[1] into a json string then back into an array then use array_keys to create an array of the keys.",0
2577,"first of all, we should decide which function to use.",0
2578,"as your goal is to capture the content between the curly brace, i choose preg_match_all to easily handle the task.",0
2579,"of course, you can do it with preg_split the hard way :)",0
2581,"if so, (and if you don't want to use mod_wsgi instead as suggested earlier) take a look at the documentation for the request object .",0
2583,"an example, to get the full uri of the request, you'd do this:",0
2584,you'd better be accurate of what functions you execute.,0
2585,"sql_next_result() is no standard php function, nor is it in mysqli which you seem to use.",0
2587,nobody here can but quess what sql_next_result() does.,0
2590,"your regex \[a-z]([0-9]) matches a literal [ (as it is escaped), then a-z] as a char sequence (since the character class [...] is broken) and then matches and captures a single ascii digit (with ([0-9]) ).",0
2592,"you cannot use the character - while declaring variables or functions, etc..",0
2593,so the $user-again tries to store the value but as there is a syntax error it won't be able to.,0
2594,"i would recommend you to use a decent ide, it can help you fix minor bugs, etc!",0
2597,you can use $_post variable many times within single script till the execution is not completed:-,0
2598,the easiest thing would be to create a function that takes pdoexception and did the logging logic.,0
2600,"if you wanted a more oo solution though, subclassing pdo and having it catch pdoexception then throw a subclass or custom exception class that has a log method or similar, that is a sound approach.",0
2601,the whole setup looks unusual to me.,0
2603,"to my understanding, the general way to handle errors would be single application-wide exception handler which doing all the job - either shows the error on-screen or log it and while sending 503 to the browser.",0
2604,"on any error, not only pdo errors.",0
2605,as i find every error extremely useful and deserves equal treatment.,0
2606,to do so one have to set their own error handler to throw an exception and set up exception handler to log errors.,0
2607,and set up global try-catch block for the entire application.,0
2608,"while for these few non-critical parts which an application can survive without, it is possible to use a try-catch block with a logger inside, but again, i don't understand why pdo only - i'd wrap whole such block, and log every error occurred, not only pdo-risen.",0
2609,"so, an exception of some distinct type (which triggers only logging but not halting the application on catch) can do the trick.",0
2610,firstly you have to know about implode() function.,0
2612,so you must include an array as the second parameter and the separator as first parameter.,0
2614,if $user_id is an array the the implode function should work without error.,0
2615,"that's because when you hit the 2nd, 3rd, ... page(after navigating from the 1st page), the $_post array would be empty i.e.",0
2616,"since you're not sending any sensitive data with the form, use get instead of post in the method attribute of the form, like this:",0
2617,"subsequently, you need to attach that search query in each of your pagination links, so that the search query would be available when you hop from page to page.",0
2620,"i think i see where ukautz is coming from; you're finding certain youtube-only link text in your preg_match, yet in your preg_replace your regex doesn't care about youtube-specific text.",0
2621,"if you were somehow able to isolate out the links before preg_matching them, this should solve the problem; however an easier solution might be to just combine your preg_match regex with your preg_replace regex.",0
2624,"i would suggest you take a moment to read through this article on pdo, prepared statements and the right way to insert/update data into your model.",0
2625,i think you should use $_get['if'] instead of $_get['id'] as the url parameter is named if .,0
2626,you could include the edit-page according to the id you passed through the url.something like: if($_get['id'] == edit) include('edit.php'),0
2627,you may want to set the database character set to utf-8 before inserting your records.,0
2628,run the query below before any insert query.,0
2629,"since you are using pdo, you can do something like this:",0
2630,"the issue is that your making a $_post call with jquery and in that function you ""post"" under the new name email_pass .",0
2631,update your php file to reference $_post['email_pass'] and you'll be good to go.,0
2632,you have to execute the statement first than fetch the result.,0
2633,here's an example of catching an exception.,0
2635,now you don't need to worry about checking if they're set or not.,0
2637,"-> $tag isn't an existing var for now, if you want to call $tag you should previously do :",0
2638,keep in mind that str_replace returns a string.,0
2640,"the str_replace function returns the modified string, you have to set your url like this:",0
2642,"if you are trying to modify the url stored in a variable, this is possible.",0
2644,if you want $url to match the return value of str_replace :,0
2647,"if you want those values as separate array entries, you'll have to submit multiple input fields:",0
2648,instead of the explode line you could use following to get a correct sql query:,0
2649,"well after $first_word = explode("" "", $question_text); $first_word is an array because explode returns and array",0
2653,"to get the variable into your form, you would need to change the first line to this:",0
2654,"first loop will give an array of images with all resolutions, while the second one an array with only standard_resolutions, use print_r to inspect the arrays.",0
2655,to put these images to a gallery use foreach loop.,0
2656,see the php manual on how to use an array.,0
2657,this doesn't work as pass_w is not a constant.,0
2658,you must use quotes for the index: $_post['pass_w'] .,0
2664,"while you're at it, you should also probably change mysql_fetch_array() to mysqli_fetch_assoc() , for two reasons:",0
2667,you need to cast the value to an integer (int) first before binding it.,0
2675,"if it were - for instance - mysql, then you need to add an extra column to the work order table (and others.",0
2678,since you are concerend about school kids screwing with your datbase,0
2679,"1) google for how to make mysql more secure 2) hint this will involve prepared staments 3) use post, rather than get, so that you have urls like http://192.1.68.1.1/application rather than http://192.1.68.1.1/application?user=smith which tempt users to muck around with the url ""just to see what happens"" (probably more of a danger than sql injection at school level, but ... you never know 4) hit the libbrary for soemthign like o'reilly's php &amp; mysql for dummies in 24 hours for complete idiot beginners - or find a god online tutorial 5) ""i would like to be able to limit that particular user to viewing only the work orders they generated"" read up on where in sql select 6) change the mysql root password - or even add anew user with root-like access then delete root 7) make sure that no student has acess to the server, lest they look at the php and see your mysql user &amp; password",0
2681,if it was: then it simply echoes the string the user inputted.,0
2682,"if you are having problems distinguishing between your radio buttons and other form fields, you could modify the names of your radio buttons slightly to get them all into a single array:",0
2686,"so you need to access by $row[0]['name'], or use",0
2688,you need to fetch the row one by one which can be done via fetch_row method of mysqli .,0
2690,"as in, check if there is a space in a string by using explode?",0
2691,but this isn't the most efficient way to do it.,0
2692,you do not need $_server['http_referer'] if you want to redirect to the same page or refresh it.,0
2693,it could simply be done using header('location : .,0
2694,the $_session is variable (almost) like any other for duration of the script.,0
2695,"so if you write it on one line of the script, you can read it later.",0
2696,no matter if sessions work or not in your environment.,0
2698,and it does not show anything that could help explaining your problem.,0
2699,"you should show us instead, what did you try to do to make sessions working.",0
2700,and where and how do you actually set the url session variable?,0
2701,"if you want to overcome this design feature, try this:",0
2702,"this way, you'll always have $_post['check_box_1'] set in the callback page, and then you can just check its value to see whether they checked it or not.",0
2704,"in your case, it could be avoided, by splitting things in several steps :",0
2705,"masking errors is generally not such a good idea (in this case, it shouldn't hurt much... but, still) and the @ operator has a cost, speaking of performances 1 .",0
2706,one-liners is not a goal one should necessarily have ;-),0
2707,the source of your problem is quoting.,0
2708,"you should use a prepared statement with placeholders, and let the mysql driver figure out how to insert the values in a syntactically valid way.",0
2709,"you can use mysqli_ functions similarly to mysql_ ones, and just add a couple extra calls to handle the parameters.",0
2710,you do need an explicit database handle (i call it $dbh below; it's returned from mysqli_connect() ) instead of relying on an implicit one like the mysql_ functions let you do.,0
2711,"or you could use pdo, as in mihai's answer, which is a bit different.",0
2713,that way you can debug your script.,0
2715,"second, every time you run this page, its going to try and insert things into the database.",0
2716,"if for whatever reason, the first_name input was not submitted (maybe the input isnt on the page when the form is submitted, for example) then php yells at you about $_post['first_name'] not being set when you try to use it so you should do this instead.",0
2717,try to use $_server['http_referer'] it will return you previous url.,0
2718,however you need to store it in some hidden field or session like you are doing now.hope this help :),0
2720,you could use for example $that-&gt;dbh-&gt;errorinfo() but you should look into exceptions for a more robust way to catch all errors.,0
2721,"$user has its value coming from the bd::get method which return the value from the db::action method which could be returning false , so you would need to test if $user is false .",0
2722,at this point you should also test the query by hand on the database.,0
2723,and also try to get the pdo errors if any.,0
2724,"there are no form tags around your register form, so its hard to see how any data is getting into the script anyway.",0
2725,your'e also silencing ( @ ) errors.,0
2726,"if this is a learning task, which from your comments i assume it is, thats a very counterproductive thing to do.",0
2727,"as you only set $_session['id'] in the login handing script, its not going to be available across pages unless they go through that form.",0
2728,"its hard to tell from your code what your'e intended user journey is, but as it stands at the moment it looks like your'e expecting them to register, then be able to see the account page as a logged in user.",0
2729,"also, your'e query in the my_account.php is looking for a column customer_id which (as far as i can see) you dont actually set in the insert statement.",0
2730,"this is the trouble with programming, it only does what you tell it to do.",0
2731,php://input is a stream wrapper over raw input body.,0
2732,it's parsed by php automatically so you could get $_post in your code.,0
2733,if it doesn't - this means that it is in an unexpected format.,0
2735,that's why you need to read and parse it manually.,0
2736,i suspect there went something wrong with the required file includewisdom/class.user.php .,0
2738,there can be also corrupted database tables for the user data when trying to check if the user is logged in.,0
2739,check your database and the hosting log files for any errors.,0
2740,put error_reporting(e_all); at the top and then generate a division by zero warning and throw a custom error to see if php errors are working:,0
2741,if you see the warning and the fatal error then you can see errors and you can continue.also try to throw a custom error imidiately after the $user_home = new user(); ; maybe there is some other code inside the class.user.php that disables error_reporting .,0
2742,directly place the post detection immediately after the error_reporting(e_all);,0
2743,"if you don't see the message, the the php script does not execute at all and maybe there is some server user pool restrictions for the current user running the php script view_teacherupdate.php under that particular site.if you see the post btnupdatenew exists after you post the form, then the form is ok and the problem is somewhere at the user managment calls new user(); or $user_home-&gt;is_logged_in() .",0
2744,maybe there is something triggering an exit .,0
2745,"to check this, try to print something after the check and call the $user_home-&gt;is_logged_in() function like this:",0
2746,"if you don't see the message, then you got the problem and it's hidding insinde the user managment class; at its code or logic or maybe some data corruption when trying to read user info from the database.",0
2747,"if you see message ""user is logged in"" then put a post debug at the top of view_teacherupdate.php like this:",0
2749,this is a lot more efficient than storing them in a database for temporal purposes.,0
2750,so you can set the variables with $_session['fname'] = $_post['fname']; etc.,0
2751,and then call them later with echo $_session['fname']; etc.,0
2754,i think you could use variable variables for this.,0
2755,doing it the way you show in your question:,0
2756,will really just print out what you are trying to accomplish instead of actually doing it.,0
2757,instead you can use this to get the variables you want:,0
2760,but these functions are deprecated and you should look into changing your code to use mysqli or pdo instead.,0
2763,longer answer: 'cannot use a scalar value as an array' means that a scalar value (e.g.,0
2764,number) exists in the variable that you are referencing as an array.,0
2765,"i do not see anywhere that you assign a scalar directly to $_session[""count""] .",0
2766,"however, if register_globals is enabled $count would become a reference to $_session[""count""] , which means $count = 0 would be setting $_session[""count""] to a scalar.",0
2767,"again, the preferable solution would be to disable register_globals, but a workaround would be to rename the $count variable to something else.",0
2768,you have to pick the second part after you explode.,0
2769,"if your initial data is an array, just explode them again each them gather them inside then finally use implode.",0
2771,1 - urlencode() : use this function in the place you should generate the url to encode the string for url format.,0
2772,"3 - use $_server['query_string'] : if you have only one param, you could get all the query_string this way.",0
2774,"running json_decode on $return will not work because it is no json, it is a javascript (as you said this api is intented for javascript).",0
2775,i believe this is valid json depending on what you are using to decode it.,0
2776,"in php this isn't valid, because the keys/names must be enclosed in double quotes not single quotes.",0
2778,"in your specific case, if someone shirt_types_id with a value of ""0 or (1=1)"", then the sql that you will create will look roughly like this:",0
2780,"you are missing linebreaks, and all.",0
2783,"with a little addition to the parameters, you could easily lose your database.",0
2785,what if i enter a name which is new to the database.,0
2786,"in that case, the update statement will fail, you will need to use insert into instead.",0
2789,"you can't use that function above since this takes into account the whole array batch for uniqueness, as you can already see, some fileid differs already with the same filename.",0
2790,"if you need it based on filename , then a normal loop should suffice.",0
2791,you are using {} outside the quotes.,0
2792,you need to use it inside the single quote.,0
2795,cannot get rows when it does not match anything which is why you get the error.,0
2798,so my answer is with pdo,0
2801,"in your case, you may only had to replace array_push($arrayturnover, $arrayyear); and put something like",0
2802,the current old version is 5.3.16 and 5.4.6 is the version you should really use.,0
2804,the reason your implode application isn't working is because $description is an associative array.,0
2805,i would recommend making it a multidimensional array so you could implode.,0
2806,you would do so with this code:,0
2807,"and specifically the ending ' after 0, indicating it is a string.",0
2808,"manually typecasting the variable is needed, even if you pass the expected pdo type:",0
2809,the value of form elements will only be added to $_post if the elements are named using name= .,0
2811,"when you output &lt; to html, browser take it as start of tag, whole problem here is that you don't use entities so take a look at htmlentities and html_entity_decode",0
2813,it had not been releasead at the time of the question.,0
2814,"this is a little more complete than @issam zoli's answer, as it provides room for returning, for example, text/xml when an application/xml is requested.",0
2815,"his answer is great for a lower-level understanding of what must be done, if one wishes to implement on his own, instead of using a third-party bundle.",0
2816,"then on the page which handles the form, the variable will be available in $_post['week_select']",0
2817,"self.location redirects the browser, you are redirecting to the same page with the addition of the url parameter email = 1 which of course runs the script again causing an infinite loop.",0
2818,you should check whether $_post contains valid values and only then insert into the database.,0
2821,i would suggest using post instead of get for destructive / manipulative operations though.,0
2823,"if you do not actually want users to enter html into the name field, don't worry about filtering data on the way into the database.",0
2824,escape it on the way out via htmlspecialchars() or htmlentities() .,0
2826,"edit: almost forgot, make sure the expected values in $_get / $_post actually exist before attempting to use them, eg",0
2827,"if $_post['params'] is a json encoded string, you only have to call json_decode once, not the multiple times that you have shown.",0
2828,"it should be noted that the string in your question is not valid json, as email and password need to be quoted, as well.",0
2829,you can do live testing of the json_decode function here: http://php.fnlist.com/php/json_decode,0
2830,perhaps you mean to check for $_session['user_name'] .,0
2831,you will also want to make sure the variable exists.,0
2832,do you have error checking turned on?,0
2833,put this at the top of your code:,0
2834,this would provide you with the full path of keys to reach the current part of the array in the $keypath variable.,0
2836,"if you're feeling really dirty, you might even use eval for this as a valid shortcut, since the source of the input you'd give it would be fully within your control.",0
2838,i'm not sure how a foreach compiles but if you get weird errors you may want to separate your finding logic from the deleting logic.,0
2839,"notes : you don't need to use is_string here, you can just make the comparison as you're comparing to a string and the value exists.",0
2841,i have arrived at a solution that is a spin-off of the function found at http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php#79535 ( array_search documentation).,0
2849,"all that said, and assuming you fix your sql injection vulnerability, the use of a temp table here is pointless and wasting resources.",0
2851,"if you use them without calling exit() immediately after, the script will continue to execute.",0
2854,ok first of all you are using a prepared statement but binding your values incorrectly.,0
2855,the sql you give to mysqli::prepare should look like:,0
2856,then you use mysqli::bind_param to bind the data to those values.,0
2857,"unfortunately mysqli::bind_param makes you bind them all at once and takes a variable number of arguments - one for each param to be bound, and they have to be by reference which makes it even more annoying.",0
2858,so lets get to your data... what we will eventually need in order to run the sql statement is an array that looks like this:,0
2859,however in order to craft the query properly we need to have things organized like:,0
2860,so the first thing we need to do is organize this properly:,0
2861,so now we get to the heart of the matter... the actual insert with mysqli :,0
2862,"to harness php's built-in support for automatic associative array generation directly from html form, here is a brief introduction:",0
2863,"also, there is a related so question that might be a help too:",0
2864,"if you change the name of your input to the_same[] - $_request['the_same'] will become an array of those values, first to last in element order (all current browsers i believe).",0
2866,"for instance, an &lt;input name='the_same[apple][2]'/&gt; would become $_request['the_same']['apple'][2]",0
2867,"an example of using that to your advantage could be with a checkbox, as the html checkbox only submits a value when checked, you may want to submit a ""not checked"" value somtime:",0
2868,"sql injection by sending ""0'; truncate messages;--"" in the last message post field cross site scripting - if users can submit messages with html/javascript they will be returned in the content without escaping.",0
2869,have you tried removing the echo statements to see if that improves run time?,0
2870,prepared statements do not add slashes to your query data.,0
2871,"they inject the parameters into the query in the form of placeholder, in such a way that the placeholder is not considered as part of the query, but as part of the data only.",0
2872,"if slashes are added for you, make sure you disable prepared statements emulation for your pdo instance:",0
2873,you're assuming that $_post['code'] contains literal ss&amp;246i value.,0
2874,but you cannot know if it's true or not - you never verified it.,0
2875,"so, you have to place a verification code in your script to be sure.",0
2877,but you cannot know if it's true or not - you never verified it.,0
2878,"so, you have to run some code to verify the assumption - try to select a hardcoded literal value instead of posted one.",0
2881,"to check if a post request has been made, you should use:",0
2884,when i do similar things with db queries (where results can commonly be null in select queries) i do a test to see if the variable has been set.,0
2886,you have to use isset to check the same.,0
2889,"you're concatenating to an undefined variable, with $error .= .",0
2890,"additionally, you should not change between mysqli and mysql , stick with mysqli .",0
2891,"if you go object oriented mysqli, it will save you time.",0
2892,"if i'm understanding correctly, you're wanting to take data in an array like",0
2893,"if that's the case, you can use php's implode function:",0
2895,"if you adopt the previous point, change your whole file to become something like",0
2899,they are probably using an .htaccess to rewrite the url (mod_rewrite).,0
2901,"so, assuming that they're using php (i don't know), they retrieve the param using $_get['id'];",0
2902,this would mean that yourdomain.com/anythinghere123thatsanalphanumeric would pass on the value after the slash to your $_get['id'] .,0
2903,"you need to serialize all your inputs/quantities if you will have the same name ""qty"" in all fields.",0
2905,"debug or make a print_r($_post) just to verify if the array is populated, the superglobal $_request is also populated with post values.",0
2906,your autos table should have a primary key ( say stocknumber or vin plus model) so no duplicate or empty values are inserted.,0
2909,"you could probably store whatever the user enters as plain text, then just echo it back on to the page when it needs to be displayed.",0
2910,this code worked when i tried it for i believe what you are trying to do.,0
2911,i suspect it is giving you three when you refresh the page because the old $_request['array_index'] is still hanging around.,0
2912,"you need to set a session variable to indicate that the action has been completed, and check it before proceeding to do this action.",0
2913,what you are doing with your code is that if a $_request of action equals value duplicate then you are doing the following things:,0
2915,what is happening here is that the cloning instructions should be valid only when you click the duplicate link.,0
2916,i suppose you have your php in the same file as the html so when you open it in a new window the cart is updated with 2 items and stored in session (which is common to all instances of your page) and when you reload your page the same 2 items are fetched from the session and showed to you.,0
2917,also here you need to observe that the $_request['action'] is still present so its duplicating 1 item more.,0
2918,now whenever you refresh the page it will keep on duplicating 1 item more.,0
2923,that means you have to escape the id parameter before inserting them into a query.,0
2924,i recommend to use prepared statements.,0
2925,"you are overwriting $categories at each iteration, it should be:",0
2926,find and replace isn't what explode is for.,0

2941,"you can add a custom option to the cart and not have to instantiate the product object and save a custom option to do this, it can be done via tacking onto an observer, and pulling the quote items.",0
2942,"quick piece of handy info, if it dumps a stack trace in front of you it can't find the defined option, lose the getvalue() (if using var_dump) function to see if you are getting a null value, otherwise xdebug will give you a ton of hints to get around it.",0
2944,"in your case you're calling a function , which certainly exists.",0
2945,hence you don't need and in fact can't use isset here.,0
2946,just use if ($this-&gt;session-&gt;flashdata('login_error')) if you want to test whether the value is truthy .,0
2948,"since you can only return instantiated variables, isset is invalid there.",0
2949,your best bet would be to do it like:,0
2952,"your include(""$root/config.php""); ""fixed"" it because it opened a 2nd mysql connection for the 2nd query to run.",0
2953,"this is not suggested, and the solution is that you need to ""buffer"" the results of the 1st query so that mysql can run the other(s).",0
2956,you can get what you want with just one.,0
2957,you just need to join the tables.,0
2959,"in your case, you can add an additional method to the class, as well as getparams (which presumably just returns the contents of $_request ), add a getparam() method:",0
2960,this has to do with how php stores references to array elements.,0
2962,"therefore it has to store the value array('oh snow') in a ""slot"" of the symbol table, then make $arr and $a[2] a reference to that value.",0
2963,"first of all, there is an error in your code, which is the following: &lt;form action=""&lt;?php $_server['php_self'];?&gt;"" method=""post""&gt; will always return &lt;form action="""" method=""post""&gt; , as $_server is an array which have to be echoed: use this &lt;?php echo $_server['php_self'];?&gt;",0
2964,"then, as code for your php this works well: it receives two vars from post, and if the contender (which is the select) contains a value different from 0, it will put it inside the $contender variable.",0
2965,"at this point, you can use this variable in your function.",0
2967,"for example, you could use a js function like this:",0
2968,your code is setting the value of $_session['box_status'] to the current value of $_post['box_status'] .,0
2969,sending this form will bring you to the 'thispage.php' page.,0
2970,"inside of 'thispage.php', if you were to access $_post['someinput'] , that would give you the value that was placed inside the textbox named 'someinput'.",0
2973,so you can use &lt;?php echo $_session['box_status']; ?&gt; to print your box_status data in to any of php page.,0
2974,"if $_get['edit'] is not set, $row is not an array but an empty string and that leads to that error.",0
2975,"to solve that, everywhere where you want to use it, you would need a construct like:",0
2978,"further on i improved pattern like this: ""#http://domain.com/([=a-za-z\d/-]+)(.|\n|\r)([a-za-z\d/-]+)#"" this urls have = and that was removed with this line: $var1=preg_replace(""#=(.|\n|\r)#"","""",$var); this is not the best way to go, but it worked.",0
2979,"i got my links in array, and later i was able to download files with file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() changing links was easy with str_replace .",0
2980,everything is done with for loop because number of links in each email was not the same.,0
2984,"a mechanic is not going to focus on learning carborated engines, they are going to focus on fuel-injection systems.",0
2985,"&lt;input type=""button""&gt; does not by default propagate post.",0
2986,"therefore you either need to use a ""submit"" type:",0
2987,submit: the button submits the form data to the server.,0
2988,"this is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value.",0
2989,reset: the button resets all the controls to their initial values.,0
2993,"if you want to decode the json string you have to point to add the array index where the string is located, so your code should look like:",0
2995,"as per your comment on this answer... if you want to populate your hidden field then you have to use the javascript created functions, in which these functions will be called whenever there will be a change in the value of select box, the function will fetch the values from all the three select boxes and implode them in your desired format as dd-mm-yyyy.. and populate the hidden field with this newly created value",0
2996,below would be your function it is not the tested one.. but you have to do it like this:,0
2997,"first of all make all the id attribute of the select box different say id='airdate_day' for day select box, id='airdate_month' for month select box and id='airdate_year' for year select box",0
2998,"and now when the form is posted your $_post['episode_airdate'] will contain a complete date, hence you don't have to use implode() function in it and can directly apply your datetime() function ove the $_post['episode_airdate'] variable",0
3000,the best way to see what you've got is to echo savexml() which will display the xml for a given element.,0
3003,"that is incorrect, you are right.the variable name will always be $options_pool .you can pass the keys as explode(':', $name) and later assign them.",0
3004,the problem you are facing above specifically can (and should) be solved with post/redirect/get .,0
3005,unsetting _post on the php side would be ineffective since the problem is it is a separate request.,0
3006,you also have to deal with double-clicking of submission buttons.,0
3007,"you can solve this on the client side by disabling form submission after the button click, or by putting a random token in the form and storing that token in the session.",0
3008,the token will be accepted only once (session keeps track of whether the token has been posted).,0
3009,"here's a nice method i use to keep users from submiting the same data twice, which will also prevent the page from adding the same record to the database when reload.",0
3010,the first if checks to see if the $_post is equal to the last thing they typed ( $_session ).,0
3012,inside the last if towards the bottom it sets $_session['dup_comment_body'] to equal the $_post .,0
3013,"so next time the first if runs and the $_post is the same, they will get the message ""you already entered that."".",0
3014,"it happens when you are trying to access a value which is not set for that index, please read this link for more information.",0
3015,ignore these notices by telling the php error_reporting to not show notices error_reporting(e_all ^ e_notice); but it is a good practice to fix this error by adding a check if a value exists.,0
3017,and then replace $_session['output'] in your code by $output variable.,0
3018,you need to use ajax with jquery to be able to send your value:,0
3021,"if you want to still on mysql and to don't use mysqli or pdo , you can use this mysql function to escape strings from the user to prevent sql injection :",0
3023,you can use $.get for your get requests and $.post for your post requests,0
3024,if a value you use to create html content might contain characters that are special in html then you must encode those characters using their correct html definition.,0
3025,the php function htmlspecialchars() knows how to do it.,0
3026,"it encodes &lt; , &gt; , &amp; and "" (these are html breakers if they are not encoded properly).",0
3028,you need to assign the users session to the user id.,0
3029,i'd strongly suggest using prepared statements for this as it's so much more practical and effective (and also bind your params (if you're not currently)).,0
3030,"as fred mentioned above, your code is possibly vulnerable (dependant on your queries and if you have hashed your passwords!!!",0
3031,after hours of banging my head against a wall i found a solution.,0
3032,since this stored procedure calls another stored procedure which uses a cursor i had to use the $mysqli-&gt;multi_query() function.,0
3033,here's how i got it working:,0
3034,"change $term = $_post['term']; to $term = $_get['term']; , and then whenever you output links to next/prev etc.",0
3036,this way the term will be sent to the server every time the user clicks next/prev.,0
3039,one thing you can do is always check the variable with isset (e.g.,0
3040,isset($_post['ch1']) ) before using them; another is to name your checkboxes the same thing with a [] following the name (e.g.,0
3041,"name=""languages[]"" ) and then do something like this:",0
3042,there are a great many ways to do this.,0
3043,hopefully you will be interested in learning many of them.,0
3044,"i cant see your database design, so you'll have to make sure that your database columns and table match correctly with what is specified in your database.",0
3045,echo your variables to make sure none are empty.,0
3047,make sure your form method is post and that your name attributes match what you have specified in your variables ie $_post['name_attr'] .,0
3048,the order of your insert columns should be the same order as in your table.,0
3051,you must actually assing something in $_session array to get results.,0
3055,you can use str_replace i am posting some code may be it can help,0
3056,"as stated in the comments the problem is not that is_array() is not working, the problem is you are not testing to see if the array has any rows.",0
3057,your way of doing it is just fine.,0
3059,if i were doing it i would probably short circuit the if statement like this:,0
3060,that way you skip echoing out the header and the bother of the foreach - which right now is hitting and not executing because the array is empty.,0
3061,you should check the mysql reference manual under c.5.2.9.,0
3062,mysql server has gone away .,0
3065,"since you are running long maintenance scripts, i suspect that's the reason.",0
3067,you should also look into migrating from 5.3 to 5.4 notes.,0
3068,it's hard to pinpoint the issue without looking at your code.,0
3070,use the sdk like the documentation states and you will be much better off.,0
3071,"if you want access to the user id, just use:",0
3072,hii michael you can set the ajax post request like this,0
3073,also it will be better to check isset outside the function.,0
3078,"the better answer is that what you're doing looks dangerously like relying on globals, and there's no reason to keep things like user e-mail addresses as global variables.",0
3079,consider taking another look at your application architecture to see why you need to do this.,0
3083,"i normally set up what you mentioned, a config.php in an include directory, and have the following line in it: define('base_path', str_replace('/include', '', dirname(__file__))); (""/include should be whatever directory your config.php file is in, if you have it in the root directory, you can just use define('base_path', dirname(__file__)); ).",0
3084,"when i want to include any other file after that, i use include_once(base_path .",0
3085,note: this concept is not original to me by any means.,0
3086,"i think, you want to append the values to original string, if the strpos of value is positive but it is not exactly available in the string :",0
3087,to get the last inserted id using pdo (not mysql_insert_id() ) you'd do this:,0
3088,"to convert the rest of your mysql_* queries to pdo, you'd probably want to do something like this:",0
3090,they are no longer maintained and are officially deprecated .,0
3092,"if you choose pdo, here is a good tutorial .",0
3093,array_sum() works by adding up the values in an array.,0
3095,"if you have a comma-separated list, and want that to be an array, i would use the explode() function to turn the list into the proper key=>value pairs that array_sum() would expect.",0
3098,"however, many languages, not just php, deal with user input.",0
3099,"user in this case could be a human, another computer service etc.",0
3100,you usually store that input inside a variable.,0
3101,"a great example is php's $_post , $_get , $_server , $_session .",0
3103,"someone can submit that form, they can fill in both inputs.",0
3104,"or only one of them, or even none.",0
3105,"you don't know what they've done, but regardless - php will provide you with a variable that might contain correct input.",0
3106,"if i submitted that form with nothing filled in, and if you tried to access a value for first_name - you would get a php warning - and you don't want php warnings.",0
3107,"therefore, before working with user input (in this case with a $_post superglobal array), you would check whether i filled in everything properly and you'd do that with:",0
3108,"do this instead and give it a go (btw that for loop is suspect big time as well, consider what you're trying to achieve)",0
3109,"caveat is this will give you a nested array, $terms[0] will be an array of $k values, while terms[1] will be an array of $t values.",0
3110,look into array_merge if you just want one big flat array,0
3111,"in this situation empty makes more sense, because it also checks whether the string is empty.",0
3112,isset just checks whether if it is defined.,0
3113,you might also want to trim the input.,0
3114,"so you should just do $text = str_replace(""\r\n"", '', $text);",0
3115,"first, any time that you are performing ajax requests you must perform them on a web-server!",0
3116,an ajax request is an http request made to the server just as if you were loading any other web page.,0
3119,"if i was to do this i would do it all in jquery (since you're using it already) which keeps you from having any inline code in your markup, which is way cleaner:",0
3120,make sure to add a name to the input when you remove the inline code:,0
3121,in addition your script is at risk for sql injection attacks.,0
3124,use php isset in order to check if the post variable is there or not in a ternary comparison:,0
3125,"orderbyraw() expects the second parameter to be an array of bindings, not an array to implode for one binding.",0
3126,"but on the other hand, if you implode it, it will be passed in as one string '2, 3, 4' , when you need a comma delimited list of numbers.",0
3127,"also, you may want to check the difference between roll and role before you code too much ;)",0
3128,your php script executes when the page loads.,0
3129,"to prevent this, you need to add if(isset($_post['submit'])) { at the top of your php code and add name=""submit to your submit button.",0
3130,you're using $_get in the wrong way.,0
3131,so you have to use it in this way:,0
3135,so you need to escape it with a \ so is you wanted to use ' inside it you would use: (' \' ') .,0
3136,a quick look at the class shows you can't do that.,0
3137,you can use html array inputs and php to do the same.,0
3139,you can set the session with session_name .,0
3140,you have to do that on top of your page and before session_start(); .,0
3141,more info is here: how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
3144,"and to get the result of this, do the following:",0
3146,"you should also use htmlspecialchars() this will convert any characters that are ""bad"" and convert them into the html equivalent.",0
3147,"ie: ' is converted to ""&amp;#039"" and store that in the database.",0
3148,then you can use htmlspecialchars_decode() to revert it back.,0
3149,note how i removed the print_r since it’s unnecessary for a task like this.,0
3150,i also changed fopen to overwrite the file using w instead of a so the saved json is valid.,0
3151,"then when you open the file, just use json_decode like this:",0
3153,your $_server['http_x_rhn_provisioning_mac_4'] output is eth4 00:02:c9:4f:xx:xx which also has a prefix eth4 where as your $table has 00:02:c9:4f:aa:bb which makes the keys mismatch and actually you are trying to get $table['eth4 00:02:c9:4f:xx:xx'] which is non existent in your $table array,0
3154,you would have ensured that ?problem_id= is numeric.,0
3155,"all of your other fields may still be at risk though, so this isn't the proper way of securing against sql injection.",0
3158,"first json_decode the json string, so we can work with it in php.",0
3160,there can be lots of ways/tricks for this.,0
3161,"$_session can be one of them / $_cookie can be one of them / through some js you can use browser local storage, etc.",0
3162,the main concept will be the fact to keep the values somewhere where a browser refresh doesn't effect.,0
3164,i think these two parts are not connected.,0
3165,as long as you are using regular select options for showing your options - they are not connected -- as your part two deals with styling your option values not how the work.,0
3169,"to the top of your file, just below the session_start() , and it will behave as you intend.",0
3170,"the way your code is written now, the session variable is not set until after the form displays.",0
3171,you want the session variable to be set before the form displays (if in fact the $_post username is set).,0
3172,and at the dashboard you can do this if it's of client,0
3175,$mysqli is not an object it is an empty variable defined at the global line.,0
3176,"global is used to make a variable accessible in a function, it doesn't appear you need that.",0
3177,your connection currently is $conn .,0
3179,unless you are using $conn in other files.,0
3180,if this is your first file this should be fine.,0
3181,once that is corrected though your queries will be built incorrectly.,0
3182,you would have a built query as,0
3183,you need to separate out the user input and only append the columns you want to search on to the query.,0
3185,if they are not the inputs should be surrounded by single quotes.,0
3186,"note that session_start(); should always be on the first line of the page, then you will start adding things later.",0
3188,"if php sees more than one input with the same name, it just takes the last one.",0
3189,this before you continue to use mysql and not mysqli.,0
3191,the value of $domain was never declared.,0
3193,"the array_values part is to reset the indexes of your array, so that accessing $vals with [0] will return ""1"".",0
3194,generally in php/mysql applications there is a single account for the application to access the database.,0
3196,"this way you can then have a user logged in and authenticated by matching their credentials with their row in the database, and you can manage what permissions they have and don't have to worry about them typing their password all the time to log into the database, as the application logs into the database and not the user.",0
3197,using the w3schools tutorial as a base it would look something like this:,0
3199,seems like you are not sending the parameter ref on your url.,0
3203,"also, since i assume you are not familiar with the security procedures, read about sql injections.",0
3204,you need to get the result from the query and pass it on to mysql_fetch_row or one of the other fetch functions.,0
3205,"your input radio button name=""sort"" so you need to use $_post['sort'] .",0
3206,you can use input value as database field name so that we can easily use it in query without if...else condition.,0
3207,while the first responder's function above should work (note the other refs to $_server superglobal keys) this was only part of the op's question.,0
3208,the reason i believe is if/when these proxies actually send these alternative headers with each request.,0
3210,figure out where the memory is going and try to free it using unset or by setting objects to null .,0
3211,"if you want a survey php application, i suppose, to be clear, that you need something where:",0
3212,"a more sophisticated version will require different sets of questions based on what was replied previously, but it's out of the scope of this question, i hope.",0
3213,"the group_concat and concat here should be modified to return something like 5:option_one;6:option_two etc, so that exploding the data won't be much hassle.",0
3214,"i realize this is not the cleanest approach in terms of performance and optimization, but it should do for a non-large-scale project.",0
3215,"there is also a drawback in in the above design in that the answers to the ""multiple answer question"" are stored imploded in the ""answer"" field of the userreplies table.",0
3216,"better add another table, where every record holds an option value the user selected for this or that question.",0
3217,that way there will be no unnecessary denormalization in the database and queries for statistics will be much easier (i.e.,0
3218,querying which options were most popular in a single question),0
3219,change your sql query you have written '$cons[]' in select query which is wrong .,0
3220,"after explode you will get data as 1,2,3 so you just need to write variable in query not array and user in operator like this.",0
3221,product-types-owned is going to be an array of the checkbox values that were selected.,0
3224,"nl2br expects a string, so php will type cast the array into its default string representation, which is literally the word array .",0
3225,it doesn't slow my typing down.,0
3226,the intent of the code is still clear.,0
3227,"* ok, actually i do, but that has more to do with me having a touch of ocd rather than good development practices.",0
3228,"well, for a trivially small array, $array === (array) $array is significantly faster than is_array($array) .",0
3229,on the order of over 7 times faster.,0
3230,but each call is only on the order of 1.0 x 10 ^ -6 seconds ( 0.000001 seconds ).,0
3231,"so unless you're calling it literally thousands of times, it's not going to be worth it.",0
3232,"and if you are calling it thousands of times, i'd suggest you're doing something wrong...",0
3236,let's take a look at is_array() first.,0
3237,it's source code basically shows it's an o(1) operation.,0
3238,meaning it's a constant time operation.,0
3239,but we also need to look at the function call.,0
3240,"in php, function calls with a single array parameter are either o(1) or o(n) depending on if copy-on-write needs to be triggered.",0
3241,"if you call is_array($array) when $array is a variable reference, copy-on-write will be triggered and a full copy of the variable will occur.",0
3242,"the cast version, on the other hand, does two operations.",0
3243,"it does a cast, then it does an equality check.",0
3244,so let's look at each separately.,0
3246,no matter if it's a reference or not.,0
3247,so simply using the (array) casting operator forces an o(n) iteration over the array to cast it (via the copy_ctor call).,0
3248,the handler is just a proxy to the is_identical_function() .,0
3249,"now, is_identical will short-circuit if $array is not an array.",0
3250,"therefore, it has a best case of o(1) .",0
3251,"but if $array is an array, it can short-circuit again if the hash tables are identical (meaning both variables are copy-on-write copies of each other).",0
3252,so that case is o(1) as well.,0
3253,"but remember that we forced a copy above, so we can't do that if it's an array.",0
3254,so it's o(n) thanks to zend_hash_compare ...,0
3255,note that it looks like they scale the same for references.,0
3256,they both scale linearly for referenced variables.,0
3257,"for example, in a referenced array of size 5, is_array will perform 5 memory allocations, and 5 memory copies, followed by 1 type check.",0
3259,"so n=5 yields 11 ops for is_array , yet 22 ops for ===(array) ...",0
3260,"the last one does cast to string, an array is always casted to a string with value 'array'.",0
3261,"this check will be wrong, if the $v is a string with value 'array' (never happens in our case).",0
3262,i don't believe there's a way to alter the functionality of property_exists() using magic methods; here's a list of available magic methods in php.,0
3263,"however, you should be able to alter isset() to use any logic you like.",0
3264,this effectively fixes the (annoying) problem with isset and nulls by overriding its functionality through the magic method.,0
3265,"instead of using isset() within __isset() however, we use array_key_exists (which handles nulls as you would expect).",0
3267,depending on your needs then this may or may not be a viable solution.,0
3268,"if the above issue is a hindrance, then another option might be to define an interface with a keyisset() property, and apply that interface to all objects to be tested.",0
3269,then use $obj->keyisset('key') rather than isset($obj->$key).,0
3270,"not as elegant, but a bit better oo.",0
3274,"now, check any include or require files to make sure you aren't calling for the same variable name somewhere.",0
3275,"and will stop the undefined index errors, provided you properly check to make sure the variables exist.",0
3276,"your code has a lot of hacks copied from other examples which are making your life harder, not easier:",0
3278,"instead, you should learn how to use namespaces with simplexml, which is by using the -&gt;children() method (and maybe also the -&gt;attributes() method , which works the same way).",0
3279,"whenever you make a request to the server, pass along all the variables that you need.",0
3281,"then you can read it on the server using $_post[""pagenum""] or $_get[""pagenum""] .",0
3283,"if you do, you'll prevent people from having multiple windows open to different pages.",0
3285,"you need to pass the post data as a url query string or as an array, the problem is you post data in json format, but php does not parse json automatically, so the $_post array is empty.",0
3286,"if you want it, you need do the parsing yourself in the test.php:",0
3287,you can use this to detect whether the referral url was http://,0
3288,if you just want to check whether the user clicked a link from another site to arrive at yours then you can check whether $_server['http_referer'] exists:,0
3289,you can use this to detect whether the referral url was http://,0
3290,if you want to get string convert this array to string using implode function.,0
3291,"which is why you need to specify the key, in your case ['value'] is your key.",0

3294,"mysqli_stmt::execute() is used for insert , update and delete statements.",0
3295,rather than returning a result set it returns the number of rows effected by the statement.,0
3296,when performing a select you need to use mysqli_stmt::get_result() which will return a mysqli_result instance.,0
3297,you can then call fetch_all() on the mysqli_result to retrieve all rows of the result set as an array of associative arrays.,0
3298,"$_get and $_post both are super global variables, so these already set as array , so you should used there empty() method instead of isset()",0
3299,"you are never checking if the form was submitted on the second page, nothing ""huge"" but it could just be that a refresh is occuring and empty data is going in.",0

3309,note that your implode is wrong for the same reason; it should be:,0
3311,you must assign the result of array_merge if you want to modify one of the source arrays.,0
3312,on a side note: your code is vulnerable to sql-injections.,0
3314,you should replace the and where by and in you select query and no need of ' in $columbname,0
3315,"the problem is, since initial load, $_post values aren't populated (empty on first load),",0

3320,"first of all, i want to isolate some security issues...",0
3322,"edit: note, if you're storing the directory as the datetime ( substr(md5(time()), 0, 10) ) you will need to include this date into the database path so you know where it is.",0

3331,good that you make the transition to pdo.,0

3334,"that is the first step, but after that you need to execute it as well.",0
3335,"you already have the $database-&gt;execute() method for that, but you don't call it in your insert, update and delete functions.",0
3336,"apart from that issue, it would even be better if you used bind parameters for the updates too, and leave escaping strings up to the database.",0
3337,"you have a php object here, which contains a number of public properties you can retrieve yourself ( stdclass is the simplest class that php can make objects from).",0
3338,you can probably see from the print_r output that some data items are sensibly nested.,0
3339,"for example, if you want the city, it can be retrieved thus:",0
3340,"now, some items - such as the address - are stored in arrays within objects.",0
3342,"if you want the whole address, consider wrapping the display_address property in implode - this will join elements of an array together with a ""glue"" string, such as a comma.",0
3343,that's also in the manual .,0
3345,"thus, you'll need to wrap everything above in htmlspecialchars or htmlentities , thus:",0
3346,your code is prone to sql injection .,0
3347,this typically happens when you are trying to insert multiple values at once.,0
3348,"easy way is have a look at the data you have exploded by doing a dump on it, and see the structure and what you're dealing with, then build a foreach with it",0
3350,"if you are trying to edit a post/page, i think you may use $id = $_get['post'] ;",0

3354,"if your form posts to another page, it'll be really harder to re-display the form... if you are using redirections, you'll to pass everything in the url, and it'll be a mess (and there's a size limit, too)",0

3358,"if the validation passes, you can do a redirect to review-purchase.php with the necessary purchase information set in a database, or possibly $_session if you're not using a database.",0
3359,"if you can separate the validation code into functions, and the display code into templates to be included, you can achieve a nice separation of logic that would allow you to use them from whichever file you go with.",0
3360,"you might be able to avoid a redirect in that way, ie.",0
3361,"in purchase.php you could check if there's $_post input, validate it, and either re-display the form template, or display the purchase review template.",0
3362,you need to create or resume the session before you write into it.,0
3363,"so in your authenticate.php where you do $_session['player'] = $player; , create a session first exactly as you do it in your other files.",0
3365,"as one of the first statements, so you make sure no output has been made before it's started.",0
3366,otherwise you'll start getting errors stating that headers has already been sent .,0
3367,note: add session_start(); at the top of your authenticate.php page,0
3368,"for all those looking for more information on how virtuemart handles the actual adding to a cart, i'll explain the process of how i finally determined the problem.",0
3369,the solution is quite simple though.,0
3370,you may have noticed that most vm forms use php_self as form action.,0
3371,"the form actually submits a load of data you cannot see through hidden input fields to provide the necessary information to the php_self page saying ""the user want to do this [addcart] with these [products]"".",0
3373,"so along with the quantity controls (added by show_quantity_box()) and the submit button, you can see a load of other data being passed.",0
3374,"among this data is func=""cartadd"" and product_id=[product id].",0
3375,"unlike a simple form post where you expect just data from one pre-determined form, vm uses a file called ""virtuemart_parser.php"".",0
3376,"this file checks the submitted ""func"" to check what it is the user is trying to do.",0
3377,"then the parser will check if a function as such was registered (remember you can add your own functions in the vm config) and if so, it will execute it.",0
3378,this way you handle whether the customer added a product from the details page or the category browsing page.,0
3379,"if the customer added the product from the brwosing page - that's where it will show an error, if he added the product from the product_details page, he'll get the error at the shop.cart page.",0
3380,[product_details does not seem to have any handling for errors returned by functions],0
3381,you are using variables before declaring them.,0
3383,"because, in that case, you are using variables that are not defined, since the form is not submitted initially.",0
3386,possibly your server is configured so that $_post['title'] is not automatically aliased as $title .,0
3387,initialize $title = $_post['title'] and same for other used $_post items manually.,0
3388,php notice: undefined variable: title means that there isn't a variable called title.,0
3389,"and looking at your code, you're almost there, but have just missed out two lines.you need to assign your $_post data the variable.",0
3391,"suppressed warnings on start_session, no fix @session_start(); commented out every echo, then uncommented them this seemed to fix this, but i can't for the life of me find a reason why.",0
3394,"and for your problem, if you use pdo you'll use prepared statement.plus @abhik has right.bye ;)",0
3395,"instead of a join, you can also use a query like this:",0
3400,hm... it seems like a really messy way to insert things into database.,0
3401,as cyclone noticed you do not purify your input prior to inserting the date.,0
3402,this is wrong but its a story for another post :p,0
3403,so i blieve that $_post['pago'] will have only 2 fields 1 and 4... but their key will be 1 and 2 as inactive checkboxes will not have value and will not end-up in the array.,0
3404,i may be wrong though... shame to admit i do not remember how it works precisely o.o,0
3406,currently you are passing a non-array value to the foreach so it is never firing.,0
3407,you should restructure your $_get values so that instead of using a (manual) numeric indicator that you use an array indicator --,0
3408,"this means there's no need to worry about ""counting"" as it's all automatic and self contained.",0
3409,"it also will (probably) make the .htaccess value assigning somewhat easier as the $_get array name will always be the same (in this case, l[]= ).",0
3410,"but in order to get the correct value you need to assign it an identifier - or a key , say you're looking for a filter value - what you do is manually check the ""key"" is the one you're looking for, so you do not define the get array with all the same l&lt;number&gt; but for example using your foreach loop again, this time defining what the key is:",0
3411,so then the filter value is defined if it is present.,0
3412,this means that after this process the value of the filter in php is $pages['filter'] - clearly defined if present.,0
3413,"your code only iterates through $_get['l0'] , and will fail if that is not array.",0
3414,"so you can iterate over $_get and use only those keys which start with l , or get those values the way i suggest.",0
3415,"if you want to give the same name to all the uploaded files, then you can get the name by using $_get .for example:",0
3417,"beyond that, i didn't really check to see if there were any logical errors in the code.",0
3418,you also need to change if ( $num = 0 ) to if ( $num &gt; 0 ) .,0
3419,"in either case, you need to use a double-equal == to compare values.",0
3421,you can't use the $this keyword into a lamba function as the scope of the function does not extend to the object whose method contains the lambda,0
3422,if real_escape_string is not a method of your object but the standard msqli method you should change the line,0
3423,"the array array(self::$_instance, 'real_escape_string') is a callback array and it is used when you want to call an object method.",0
3424,a method of an instantiated object is passed as an array containing an object at index 0 and the method name at index 1,0
3425,and self::$_instance is the mysqli instance you want to call,0
3427,"you don't need to put it in your markup, css and js.",0
3428,i'd stick with absolute-relative paths like /images/background.jpg (note the leading slash).,0
3429,that way even if your page is accessed by a url like,0
3430,using document_root helps a lot when including multiple files scattered around your document root - using relative paths here gives me a headache.,0
3431,"if you really want full urls in your pages, though, you can try using $_server['server_name'] for that matter, but i really don't understand the need to do so.",0
3432,that is what is annotating the data.,0
3433,"there is nothing external in there, but you are dumping a giant object tree.",0
3434,"usually it hangs, so you're lucky you even got anything there.",0
3435,you can try adding sessions to the php pages like:,0
3437,the above code for closing database connection is for php pdos.,0
3438,"if you are using mysqli, use:",0
3444,"the challenge is, php get executed and generate the page once by server side.",0
3445,so your logic will only work when page is refreshed (re-generated).,0
3446,but the problem is that what you trying to achieve is happening on client side (by clicking browne... button) therefore we need to use javascript to solve this part.,0
3447,"one way to go, by adding following javascript at the end of your code",0
3448,this will only work if you bring the download button out side of the if statement and give it an id like id='btndownload' .,0
3450,"this is one way to solve it, the other way is, when the image get uploaded, you need to added a field in your database table to tell where the file/attachment location is, and if that field has file/attachment location, than you can dynamically create a download button by adding following condition.",0
3451,"you can go two ways, you can added extra condition !empty($_post['msg_body']) to check if field is not empty, so your code will look like this:",0
3452,you can also do it by javascript following this example .,0
3455,you will still have security problems that you need to fix.,0
3457,your problem is that mysqli_query() doesn't return a row.,0
3458,you need to need to fetch a row from your result and then assign it to $_session['depname'],0
3459,"to fix this issue, you have to modify the array format.",0
3460,"add the id to the start of the array, like so:",0
3461,"if the id variable is generated dynamically, then you can manually add it to the array start using array_unshift() function:",0
3462,"i already pointed out in the comments that this question is not very specific, though you can look on the following manuals and documentations for further information in order to do that, what you want to archive.",0

3481,"ok, since you are trying to learn.",0
3482,here is the explanation for the function in the post,0
3483,well all this does is to insert the value into the key of an array.,0
3486,check the update query format .,0
3487,"in addition, your code is highly insecure.",0
3488,"at least use mysql_real_escape_string() , e.g.",0
3489,$name=mysql_real_escape_string($_request['req-name']); to protect against sql injection.,0
3490,"i'm not sure to understand what you mean above, unless you wanted to say without using an additional visible form input .",0
3491,"if so, then the answer is contained in the question: you have merely to add a hidden input to your form (and give up buttons value):",0
3492,then in edit_post.php you can use $_post['property-id'] as you want.,0
3493,"you should use === false instead of !== true , strpos will never return true .",0
3494,"if auto-escaping is enabled, then your filter will be escaped after it is called.",0
3495,"if auto-escaping is causing you problems, then take a look at the ""automatic-escaping"" link below and see how to disable it.",0
3496,"it should go without saying--but, if you disable auto-escaping, then you are responsible for sanitizing the data before it is output.",0
3497,"php will recognize that the submitted form contains an array of filter_attr data if the name attribute of the static and dynamic inputs is ""filter_attr[]"".",0
3498,"however, the id must be unique if you wish javascript to access it using document.getelementbyid .",0
3499,"thus the first dynamic input has an id of ""filter_attr1"" and a name of ""filter_attr[]"".",0
3500,"it is better to write: document.getelementbyid(""my_div"") than to use the id or name directly (see discussion at why don&#39;t we just use element ids as identifiers in javascript? )",0
3501,"creating dynamic inputs is preferable using the dom and its methods, if you wish, you may use jquery which simplifies working with dom.",0
3502,the above html seems to be missing a submit button.,0
3503,"however, even if it is present in the actual code, the following code does not work:",0
3505,data coming from form elements where the user had to supply some kind of response whether it's text or marking a checkbox or radio button.,0
3506,"the submit button facilitates submitting the data but it itself does not get submitted if you fail to name and the name must be the same as its type, i.e.",0
3509,the code needs to assume that the post could be tainted.,0
3512,"lastly, using an html table should be restricted for displaying tabular data and should not be used for layout.",0
3513,"instead, use div elements and by styling them you can achieve the desired layout.",0
3514,this result will be semantically correct and save on memory.,0
3515,"at first i wasn't sure what exactly if output exists prior to calling this function means, but apparently there should be no output to the browser in order to set the cookie.",0
3516,"after i moved the problematic line of code before any output, the problem is gone and the code works on the above browsers (both development and production servers), plus on latest ff and chrome on android.",0
3517,"instead, you have to make it throw an exception, which is the most reliable way to get the error message.",0
3518,"to do so, in your constructor, add this line",0
3519,also note that your class is a genuine example of all the mistakes one could make writing a pdo wrapper.,0
3520,"i compiled the most popular mistakes in an article, your first database wrapper's childhood diseases and your class contains every single one of them.",0
3523,pherhaps the extra space in the '= ' was making a difference.,0
3525,"if this doesn't work, try var_dump() the $foodtrucktype variable?",0
3526,i have faced the same problem.,0
3527,"when i removed "" delimiter // "" (also // delimiter ; at the end), it worked.",0
3529,"the same drawbacks exist using pdo as with any other php database interface that does persistent connections: if your script terminates unexpectedly in the middle of database operations, the next request that gets the left over connection will pick up where the dead script left off.",0
3530,"the connection is held open at the process manager level (apache for mod_php, the current fastcgi process if you're using fastcgi, etc), not at the php level, and php doesn't tell the parent process to let the connection die when the script terminates abnormally.",0
3531,"if the dead script was in the middle of a transaction, that can block a multitude of tables until the deadlock timer kicks in, and even then, the deadlock timer can kill the newer request instead of the older request that's causing the problem.",0
3533,"it's very possible (depending on your application design) that the next script might not actually ever try to commit the existing transaction, or will commit when it should not have, or roll back when it should not have.",0
3534,this is only the tip of the iceberg.,0
3535,"it can all be mitigated to an extent by always trying to clean up after a dirty connection on every single script request, but that can be a pain depending on the database.",0
3541,"this sob-story has a point: it broke things that we never expected to break, all in the name of performance.",0
3542,"the tradeoff wasn't worth it, and we're eagerly awaiting the day we can switch back to normal connections without a riot from our users.",0
3543,"the mysqli extension supports both interpretations of a persistent connection: state persisted, and state reset before reuse.",0
3544,"before a persistent connection is reused, the mysqli extension implicitly calls mysqli_change_user() to reset the state.",0
3545,the persistent connection appears to the user as if it was just opened.,0
3546,no artifacts from previous usages are visible.,0
3547,the mysqli_change_user() function is an expensive operation.,0
3548,"for best performance, users may want to recompile the extension with the compile flag mysqli_no_change_user_on_pconnect being set.",0
3549,it is left to the user to choose between safe behavior and best performance.,0
3551,"if you are creating 1000's of connections per second you normally don't ensure that it stays open for very long time, but operation system does.",0
3552,based on tcp/ip protocol ports can’t be recycled instantly and also have to invest a while in “fin” stage waiting before they may be recycled.,0
3553,the 2nd problem... using a lot of mysql server connections.,0
3555,allows talk now about why persistent connections were disabled in mysqli extension.,0
3556,despite the fact that you can misuse persistent connections and obtain poor performance which was not the main reason.,0
3558,one trouble with using persistent connections is it does not really scale that well.,0
3559,"for those who have 5000 people connected, you'll need 5000 persistent connections.",0
3560,"for away the requirement for persistence, you may have the ability to serve 10000 people with similar quantity of connections because they are in a position to share individuals connections when they are not with them.",0
3561,persistent connections are a good idea only when it takes a (relatively) long time to connect to your database.,0
3562,nowadays that's almost never the case.,0
3564,pdo does not manage the persistence.,0
3566,if any change then it will not reuse a connection.,0
3567,the best case net effect is that these connections you have will be started and stopped so often because you have different users on the site and making them persistent doesn't do any good.,0
3569,they sound enticing but they are dangerous and pretty much useless.,0
3570,"the procedural mysql library of php, has a feature whereby subsequent calls to mysql_connect will return the same link, rather than open a different connection (as one might expect).",0
3571,this has nothing to do with persistent connections and is specific to the mysql library.,0
3575,the database is running on another server that you are accessing overthe network an (one) application accesses the database very often,0
3576,your application only needs to access the database 100 times an hour.,0
3577,"you have many, many webservers accessing one database server",0
3579,"it doesn't make so much difference if the database is running on the same machine, but it is still a little bit faster.",0
3580,"however - as the name says - the connection is persistent, i.e.",0
3581,"it stays open, even if it is not used.",0
3582,"the problem with that is, that in ""default configuration"", mysql only allows 1000 parallel ""open channels"".",0
3584,"so if you have - say - 20 webservers with each 100 clients on them, and every one of them has just one page access per hour, simple math will show you that you'll need 2000 parallel connections to the database.",0
3586,it will convert any string containing character with codes outside of 32 &gt; char &gt; 127 range into binary string.,0
3587,so if агеев is not converted to 'windows-1251' it becomes 0xd098d0b2d0b0d0bdd0bed0b2 - a utf-8 representation converted to binary string (something like ррір°рѕрѕрі ).,0
3588,"single-byte conversion (with cp1251 code page in your case i guess), if expected data type is char or varchar .",0
3589,here you need to convert parameters to windows-1251 .,0
3590,"unicode conversion, if expected data type is nchar or nvarchar .",0
3591,here you need to convert parameters to ucs-2le .,0
3592,that's why there is no other choice (at least for now) than to use iconv for parameters.,0
3593,"ps if you set connection charset right, you shouldn't need to convert $sql as it should be done by dblib.",0
3594,"or, if you have a lot of data in the array and want to avoid creating a complete copy of each element over every iteration, simply iterate over each element as a reference.",0
3595,then only a reference to that item is created i memory and you can directly manipulate the array element by using $item:,0
3596,"the net effect of what you're doing is to just replace the commas with spaces, so you can use php's built-in str_replace function:",0
3599,"if you really want an additional trailing space after that, just append it.",0
3602,make sure you are connected to the database before running it otherwise you will error.,0
3604,"which also means you should not catch connection errors (at least not there), since if the function can't return a pdo connection your script doesn't need to continue.",0
3606,"next, you shouldn't catch them, at least not using try .. catch.",0
3607,if you use fetch() with the pdo::fetch_assoc style it is easy to get both columns:,0
3608,by placing the fetch in a loop all of the rows will be returned which you can then limit as you see fit.,0
3609,you typically want to avoid accessing array indexes that you are not certain exist.,0
3610,so what's the easiest way to extract user input in a proper manner?,0
3611,note that you should also avoid ever having an excecution path that leaves a variable undefined:,0
3612,"you could use $content in that situation if it were wrapped in isset or empty, but that hampers the readability of code.",0
3613,"if you want to leave a variable undefined under some condition, define it as null.",0
3616,"in particular, you can use filter_input to avoid rewriting a lot of the code for handling user input.",0
3617,"as an aside, you should always develop with errors cranked all the way up, and you should be monitoring for any kind of error (warning, notice, etc).",0
3618,"this will help prevent potential logical bugs, and it tends to keep code clean.",0
3619,(there seems to be a correlation between code that never issues notices and well written code.),0
3620,"you have a few curly quotes in your code “ ” and ‘ ’ which will explain the ""file not found"" error for your form's action action=‘welcome.php’ .",0
3621,"you should also remove enctype=""text/plain"" - consult this answer on stack for more information about it.",0
3623,change the column names in the prepare statement to match your database columns.,0
3624,"it will update the entire database table with all the data in the html table once you click ""confirm"" in your ""save"" dialog.",0
3625,i suggest you do a lot more reading on pdo prepared statements as what you have currently is not even close to a prepared statement.,0
3626,this is also assuming the mr_id column is your primary key.,0
3627,"if it is not, you'll need to make those changes accordingly.",0
3628,you can explode the day to get an array of days,0

3631,you can use it to add a your block or set a session variable and display your block according to its value.,0
3632,make sure you have a pdo connection before your query:,0
3633,or if it is in external file then you have to include that file and have to use global $pdo to access the object like:,0
3635,i can see in your code that you send:,0

3637,"and finally, if you are using forms to send data to php then you can use something like that :",0

3643,each iteration overwrites the previous value of $ma .,0
3645,not sure what the point of using an array is when mysqli_fetch_array is an array.,0
3646,your receiving that error because the query is not working.,0
3647,what you've done in auth class is you've just created the instance of database class using the singleton pattern and trying to invoke the query method from the database instance which is not defined in the class.,0
3648,"if you want to access it like $this-&gt;dbh-&gt;query() , you need to construct an instance of database class and return the pdo instance at the same time.",0
3649,what i've just modified here is return self::$instance-&gt;pdo .,0
3651,you can now do $this-&gt;dbh-&gt;query() in auth class.,0
3652,"note, you need to do this only if you're not going to define any other methods in the database class except static methods like getinstance .",0
3653,because the result of getinstance only allows you to access pdo properties and methods.,0
3654,"so, the solution for that is to define a public method in database which returns pdo instance separately.",0
3655,"once you're done with it, you can access the pdo in auth class like:",0
3656,basically it suggest that you shouldn't echo rather than exit() your response.,0
3657,"otherwise, the remainder of the page is ""loaded"" again after the if(isset... is finished.",0
3659,you need to split the string with ; and get first element from the returned array (it will always have at least one entry).,0
3660,"depending on how it should work when "" ; "" is part or not part of the string, you need to add the needed once if you want to return the full string:",0
3661,"this is similar if you operate with strpos() , you have to deal with false case as well.",0

3665,"you don't need a custom function to get the last insert id , there is already one built into both php mysqli and php pdo extensions .",0
3666,i'm almost certain the issue is that $db_connection is null since the connection is failing.,0
3667,based on what you provided your database name should be launcher-login instead of launcher_login as you've specified in your connection string.,0
3669,"if you really need/want to not pass the id through get, you can wrap the table in a &lt;form&gt; with the action set to the page you want to send it to, with a method of post and a hidden input field.",0
3670,"i know your question says you can only use html and php; without javascript, the only way you can really do this is to add a button to the form/table.",0
3672,"when that button is clicked, the form will be posted to index.php and you can get to the id through $_post['user_id']",0
3673,"if you are willing and able to use javascript, you should be able to do the following html/php:",0
3675,i just how to fix this problem.,0
3676,this worked for me you can give it a try:just change,0
3677,you have to assign the fetch array to an array variable.,0
3678,i this is common both in mysql and mysqli.,0
3680,"if you like the foreach syntax, you can use the following class:",0
3681,i replaced the iterator method calls with a loop on a copy of the array.,0
3682,i presume this gives direct access to the internal storage since php implements copy-on-write.,0
3683,"the native foreach is much faster than calling rewind() , valid() , current() , and next() .",0
3684,also pre-calculating the strtolower on the column object helped.,0
3685,this got performance down from 35% of cycles to 0.14% .,0
3686,also experimenting with @gordon's suggestion of using an array keyed on name instead of using the internal storage.,0
3687,the above is working well for a simple drop-in replacement.,0
3688,one way is to create an array of the buttons and use the code or something else unique as the index:,0
3689,"now there will be a $_post['submit']['j7410'] if that button is clicked, so to get the code use:",0
3691,"the easy fix is to add array_push($ssrows, $ssrow); right after the foreach loop.",0
3692,"you will need to add a check for 0 rows, this should be skipped then.",0
3694,"depending on what your software solution is going to end up to be, third-party users would be more accustomed to writing to and reading from this superglobal with your custom session handlers doing the magic in the background.",0
3695,"i don't know what dom library you're using - i use domdocument myself - but you should have a textcontent property you can use to get the element's... well, text content.",0
3696,in your case you probably shouldn't be using the stupid explode in the first place.,0
3697,there are more appropriate string functions in php.,0
3698,if you just want the first part:,0
3700,the use of array_slice() is pretty foul as it will allocate a second array which is wasteful.,0
3701,"but take note that using strip_tags, you won't be able to filter off the attributes.",0
3702,you are using array_map() incorrectly for the sake of an abitrary rule you've set yourself that you won't use a loop?,0
3705,"prior to php 5.3, you had to call create_function() to create a function on the fly.",0
3706,"so array_walk and array_map were usually only used when there's a named function that does what you want, e.g.",0
3707,"but even now that you can use function to create anonymous functions, many people find",0
3708,array_map tends to be used more than array_walk because it can be used as part of a larger expression.,0
3709,"with foreach you would have to use one loop to push onto a result array, then follow it with code to operate on that array.",0
3710,"since it is a concept question, and you mentioned that the login / register system is already done, what you need to do is:",0
3711,you might have turned on register_globals in php.ini.,0
3713,it is not a best practice to turn on register_globals .,0
3714,"this redirects all requests that do not match an existing file (for example, an image) to index.php , where you can then use $_server[""request_uri""] to decide how to act.",0

3716,"additionally, if index.php cannot be found by apache, then the request will be forwarded to reserve.php",0
3717,the error you're seeing means that $this-&gt;dbmanager-&gt;db is not an object.,0
3718,thus trying to call a method on it ( prepare ) gives you an error.,0
3719,"so basically, your error has nothing specifically to do with pdo, but rather with static vs. member properties.",0
3720,"...if you aren't using a database in here, then there's nothing to do there, but if you ever store this data in a database, that's almost definitely where the mis-encoding is happening.",0
3721,"there's a lot that could go wrong in the database - from connecting, to how the data is stored, to how the data is retrieved.",0
3725,perhaps you want to do something like:,0
3726,you use both mysql_* and mysqli_* functions here.,0
3727,also you have to sanitize and validate your inputs.,0
3730,"in short, a temporary table is just that, temporary.",0
3731,it's not meant to be used for other purposes than to temporarily store some data for one specific operation.,0
3732,if you want a more permanent thing consider using a concrete table with a memory storage engine.,0
3733,your query is open for sql injection check how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
3734,a good starting point is filter_var() .,0
3735,using the right flags for validation and sanitization and makes your input save(r).,0
3737,"then you can build an array, containing your original category parent id.",0
3738,"this you can pass to array_walk() , with a callback as second parameter.",0
3739,the callback itself has assigned a collecting/ final array that is passed as reference and serves as target for your results.,0
3740,now you can loop recursively over an indefineatly nested wordpress category hierarchy.,0
3743,"sql escaping is only done to properly insert into the database and not break sql syntax, the values are stored in their unescaped form.",0
3744,"values only need to be escaped for their transition into the database , the values are never supposed to be altered permanently.",0
3745,especially with pdo you shouldn't need any escaping at all.,0
3746,"you can simply use if(filter_var($email, filter_validate_email)) to check email format or use a regex",0
3749,the above code is vulnerable to sql injection if $stuff is untrusted input.,0
3750,"you need to use array instead of string , when you use fputcsv .",0
3751,"i've also incremented the $userid with this line: $userid = count(file($file)); it reads the file lines into an array, count it, so it will always increments.",0
3752,"i've also improved your code a littlebit, with clear thos unused variables.",0
3753,"you can use $_post[""anything""] directly, you do not need to create another variable, what you do not manipulate.",0
3754,because you are using a numeric key array you could use php array_merge function to achieve exactly that,0
3755,nesting functions is fine - as long as you take readability into account.,0
3757,"if you decide to use nested functions, also make use of intelligent indentation to make it easier to see what's going on:",0
3758,"each function argument is on it's own indented line ( trim and str_replace are both being used as function arguments, as are $var , ""black"" and ""&lt;body text='%body%'&gt;"" ) the ending ))); clearly delimits where the function nesting ends.",0
3759,it also provides a quick syntax checksum (count the number of opening parentheses and make sure they match the number of closing parentheses at te end).,0
3760,"i modified the ""question code"" such as, you can do a fast check by,",0
3761,it appears that $results is empty because your query is not returning anything.,0
3762,"and i suspect your query is not returning anything, because you're doing a search for the $loginname of true (or maybe false ), because of this line:",0
3764,it's also unclear what your global $db is about.,0
3765,"if that is your literal code, then you have a clear bug in that you aren't even attempting to connect to the database.",0
3768,"you are passing a pdo-connection to mqsqli functions, thats why you get "" expected mysqli, got pdo.""",0
3769,i can bet $10 that the page you are requesting returns an error instead of text.,0
3770,"in chrome, before sending the ajax request press f12 and go to network tab.",0
3773,it's most probably a mysqli error page (chrome dev console screenshot: http://image.prntscr.com/image/84e59bfb9caf4c9b9dcf8b5f79844176.png ),0

3775,"following your code snippet, $each_item['item_id'] is not checked if it is set with something inside.",0
3776,the subsequent query will fail sometimes (sql fail if the where close is empty),0
3779,and it seems to work as normal.,0
3780,however can anyone confirm this will work going forward?,0
3781,will browsers understand this for all languages?,0
3782,or do i have to normalize the string to make sure every browser can understand the url?,0
3783,"the problem is i'm not on php 5.3, which is required to install the normalization extension for php.",0
3784,"i'm afraid it will break things if i do upgrade, i'm currently on 5.2x.",0
3785,the script doesn't stop after detecting that the name is in use.,0
3787,you should move the block of html at the top to the else clause of the if ($_post) test.,0
3788,"i just had to cast to boolean the return value, as preg_match() returns 0|1 .",0
3789,"you just have to start the session and set it like any other variable, just like you have it in the question.",0
3790,"""\n"" at the end of the code for clarity.",0
3791,"and you need to add a value attribute to the radio inputs, otherwise you won't get any value.",0
3793,"//try to use mysqli,it is much advanced and always use prepared statement",0
3794,once you have verified that it is xml you have a couple of options:,0
3795,you could check to make sure isset($rss-&gt;channel-&gt;item) existed and $rss-&gt;channel-&gt;item-&gt;count() > 0. you can use count($rss-&gt;xpath(/channel/item)) &gt; 0 .,0
3796,this way you can access any image thumbnail just by prefixing it with thumb_ with pd_image and you don't have to store pd_thumbnail in database.,0
3797,"the issue here is that, if either the first or second argument to array_merge() is not an array , the return value will be null.",0
3798,"for example, although one might reasonably expect that a call such as array_merge($somevalidarray, null) would simply return $somevalidarray , it instead returns null !",0
3800,"since you don't use $page directly but you do a mathematical operation on it, if it isn't a numeric value it will be evaluated to 0 if it isn't a number (for example, if it's a string).",0
3801,"in this case you don't need any escape function, but if you're using directly any other $_get or $_post variable, then you should consider it.",0
3804,"thirdly (and presumably why it's not working at all), you are not quoting the (presumably string) values you are sending to the db, and there are syntax errors when you're building your query - you are missing concatenation operators ( . )",0
3805,any decent editor should flag those sorts of errors before you even save the file.,0
3806,"in php though, you should not check for $_server[""server_port""] == ""80"" , as you may at some point need to run your web server on a port other than 80/443, in development for example.",0
3808,you can use a $_get parameter to let the form know if you are editing or not.,0
3809,"i guess, what you're trying to do - to get part of the variables name from the url ( $_get[] ).",0
3810,in this case you should do something like this:,0
3811,note:i really doubt it's a good practice for security reasons.,0
3814,"one way would be to simply use a foreach iterating over the array and copying it to a new array, changing the key conditionally while iterating, e.g.",0
3815,if $key === 'foo' then dont use foo but bar:,0
3816,"another way would be to serialize the array, str_replace the serialized key and then unserialize back into an array again.",0
3818,"yes, there is a definitely a big difference you need take in consideration.",0
3819,one is used to get the included script full path (current file) and the other is used to get the script path (relative to web server).,0
3820,so you might use one or the other depending of what you try to accomplish.,0
3826,not so relevant but i think it's worth noticing.,0
3827,be aware that there is also $_server['script_filename'] .,0
3828,it's better to do it using dom parser like this:,0
3829,but if you still want to use preg_match you can use this:,0
3831,inspect your template file and make sure that the style (ie.,0
3833,"in other words, make sure that there are no variables where half the variable is a different style to the rest of the variable.",0
3834,"this particular subtlety is very easy to introduce in a template file, and generally the easiest way to fix it is to simple delete and rewrite each template variable.",0
3835,"lastly, try removing the 'html' parameter when invoking the addtemplatevariable method and see whether that makes a difference.",0
3836,"if you're not actually using html, then there's no point in passing the 'html' parameter.",0
3837,"conversely, if you are using html, then the corrupted file may be a case of incorrectly structured html, causing microsoft word to flag the the document as corrupted.",0
3838,"if you're using php 5.5+, you can use array_column() , like so:",0
3839,"if you're using a previous php version and can't upgrade at the moment, you can use the userland implementation of array_column() function written by the same author.",0
3840,"alternatively, you could also use array_map() .",0
3841,this is basically the same as a loop except that the looping is not explicitly shown.,0
3842,"note: the loop will still be performed, but it will be hidden inside the aforementioned functions.",0
3843,then create a method in your class to get the attribute by code:,0
3844,"then you can make calls on the attribute object, e.g.",0
3846,in your case you need to destroy the session before checking auth in home.php to get redirected to index.php,0
3847,"and of course, you'll also get jumped on by a few dozen busybodies who'll claim that using the mysql_*() functions will cause the universe to implode in 5... 4... 3...",0
3850,there is the option of storing the value in the $_session array.,0
3851,if you only need the array for the current user and you don't need to persist the data longer that the user session.you could use a session variable for that.,0
3856,try it like this to tell pdo that you are binding an integer for it not to put '' around the variable.,0
3858,you can test by doing var_dump($_get); and your $_session['id'] will also return null .,0
3859,you must give it a value before you can get anything assigned to $_get['id'] .,0
3860,"that is pretty much it, although you still appear to be using the mysql_* functions rather than pdo in your second example.",0
3861,apart from that you'll just need to remember to use double quotes if you want your variables to substitute into the string.,0
3862,"this is because you are using variables which are not defined here, simply change to $_post array with scope for each variable you want to grab.",0
3863,here array_map is used with an anonymous function to build an array of the “weight” of each value in $arr .,0
3865,this is basically the same as boltclock suggested just with doing the comparison on the already calculated “weights”.,0
3866,if you want to access it via javascript (client-side) then use ajax to return the json and then parse it with your javascript.,0
3867,if you need the browser to keep a copy then store it in localstorage after you retrieve it from the server.,0
3869,in getdatacache.php you need to do some thing like this,0
3870,"while it's true that you can likely reduce the parsing work that a parser like html purifier does by filtering out tags before the fact, there's no security gain in using strip_tags() first, and in your use-case it likely isn't going to make much of a difference.",0
3871,"the reason it won't make much of a difference is, of course, that your average submitted content will not be malicious, and thus be submitted via your wysiwyg, which is only going to generate those tags that you already want to allow.",0
3872,"as such, you wouldn't strip out any tags in the preliminary strip_tags() run for those comments.",0
3873,"meanwhile, a malicious submission is likely to bypass any benefit strip_tags() would give you, anyway.",0
3876,strip_tags() is pretty fast and it won't mangle anything if you use it before the parser.,0
3880,"if the data needs to be treated specially, then handle this at the data level -- the actual operation of dealing with the sql should be simple, consistent, and reliable.",0
3881,"(note that mysql_real_escape_string doesn't change the data seen by the database , rather it ensures that the data is the real data -- that which was passed to the mysql_real_escape_string function -- after the database parses the sql command.)",0
3883,"this ""problem"" has been solved for many, many years with the use of placeholders which allows the sql command and the data to be kept isolated.",0
3884,"prepared statements may also be more efficient, depending upon other factors.",0
3885,"and, quite honestly, i can't see how people can stand to look at/write the mess created with string manipulation (even without all the added ""escaping"" code) of sql commands in general.",0
3886,"if you are applying the clean() function on it (which i assume is an awful mixture of stripslashes/htmlentities/addslashes), then the hash you generate with sha1() might not be the hash for the actual password.",0
3887,this will work by accident even if the password contained special charactes.,0
3889,and actually you should be properly escaping the $sha1 hash afterwards (even if unneeded).,0
3891,but to answer your question: this is working in your case; and not a problem.,0
3899,"as one can now read, they jump through a lot of hoops to fool virus-scanners.",0
3900,"i also noticed that when using most webbased tools (or even w3c validator) to fetch the source of the infected website, php did not insert the javascript, making the website look not infected !",0
3901,i also had this 'problem' when trying a simple telnet-command to (safely) get the infected code.,0
3902,"however after seeing the php code behind it, i realized i used to few http commands (specifically the referrer).",0
3903,doing: telnet infected-site.com 80 and then pasting the following finally gave the infected markup source:,0
3904,note that this way one can also safely explore (and reverse-engineer) the source of the iframe etc!,0
3905,"note that this time the numbers are in octal (base 8) (separated by , with an offset of -4 ).",0
3907,"however googling '// this code use for global bot statistic' (found in the php you supplied in your question) rendered over 4.1 million results (dating back to at least 2010), indicating that also wordpress, joomla, etc are victim of this 'technique'.",0
3908,"reading some of those links (like this , this or this ) i get the impression this started out as a way to fool search-engines (like google) in order to increase page-ranking.",0
3909,this at the price of creating a self-inflicted malware-hole.,0
3912,i don't know how your work with database but this function is simple way for ask to your question.,0
3914,have you looked into the db object and writing parameterized queries?,0
3915,"you can view the docs here , and tab down to parameterized queries.",0
3917,you would need to explicitly use serialize / unserialize only if you intend to persist values using some custom mechanism.,0
3918,the two functions are totally unrelated in purpose; the only attribute they share is that they are commonly used to provide safety to web applications.,0
3919,i'd also rollup your queries if you don't need that level of grain.,0
3920,in example on the first one:,0
3921,"this is the approach i would take to optimize performance by reducing the number of db queries, roll-up the results so less records need to be loaded into memory up front, and then loop through to get my results.",0
3922,you can just set a $_session[] variable and destroy the session if the user logs out.,0
3924,at the time of login start the session by using the:,0

3947,"10 - in you 2 &amp; 3 forms, you are using id 's that are used in the 1st form.",0
3948,this is invalid as every id must be unique.,0
3949,"what you can do, is call session_write_close in your main site script before making your curl request – at that point all data is written to the session file, and the file lock is released.",0
3950,"you have to be aware though, that you can not use the session again in your main site script instance after that – well, you can still read data from and push data into the $_session array, but since the session is already closed, all data that you alter in that array after that point will not be persisted any more.",0
3951,"so do what you have to do with the session in your main script, then close the session – and then make your curl request.",0
3952,"so try doing that instead – but be aware of the problems you might run into with that, since the browser will consider the cookie for the secondary domain as a third party cookie when you are trying to set it in the context of your main site (and the domains don’t match, e.g.",0
3953,one is not running on a subdomain of the other or something like that).,0
3954,"but again - where is a certain reproduceable proofcode contains one insert query, one hardcoded decimal value and one result?",0
3955,ugh - and table definition of course.,0
3956,you have to specify encoding as 3rd parameter of htmlspecialchars,0
3957,"first off, you need to understand that a character with a diacritic like &#243; or &#238; (from your example) is not automatically a ""utf-8 character"".",0
3958,"it is simply a character that has different encodings (if any) in different character sets, even in those character sets that have the basic single-byte ascii part in common (i.e., the english alphabet, the digits, the most common punctuation, and a few more).",0
3959,"you could call it a ""problematic character"", but not a ""utf-8 character"".",0
3960,"browsers normally automatically detect the encoding used in a page, if it is not specified.",0
3961,this is why you were initially able to see in the browser exactly what you had written in your editor.,0
3962,"then you correctly added the header('content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); , which disabled the automatic charset detection by the browser.",0
3963,"at this point it became evident that your file with the footer &lt;div&gt; was not utf-8 encoded (see again my comment for the explanation of the question marks that appear instead of the ""problematic characters"").",0
3964,so all you are left to do is convince your editor to save files utf-8 encoded.,0
3965,"as others have noted, saving the file in a different encoding does not work in all editors.",0
3966,"starting from a fresh file is sometimes the solution, maybe after having set the default encoding of your editor to utf-8.",0
3968,its output should be something like,0
3969,"or else, you could use the od -tx1z command, which dumps your file (maybe | less ), as a sequence of hex bytes with the corresponding string on the side.",0
3970,"if the file is single-byte encoded, your ""problematic characters"" will be single bytes >= 0x80.",0
3971,"if it is utf-8 encoded, they will be sequences of 2 bytes (others will be 3 or more bytes), all >= 0x80, while the ""non-problematic characters"" will continue to be single bytes &lt; 0x80.",0
3972,"you don't need the adddefaultcharset directive in the .htaccess file, though, if all your pages are generated with the content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8 http header, because the effect of the apache directive is exactly the same (and it is good to keep the control on encoding inside php).",0

3974,i dont understand your question well but if you need a key and element from position,0
3975,in earlier versions you need to break it into two lines:,0
3976,"it would also be worth using the two-line approach in 5.4+ if you have to access multiple elements, to allow you to only call the relatively expensive array_keys() function once.",0
3977,"also the dereferencing approach assumes that the specific position within the array exists, which it may not.",0
3978,breaking it into multiple operations would allow you to handle that error case.,0
3979,"although of course you don't ever need access to the key, you can simply do:",0
3980,"this is probably the least expensive way to do this assuming it doesn't create a copy of the array in memory when you do it (still researching this element), and likely the best method for multiple accesses of arbitrary keys.",0
3982,do not select * from table_name .,0
3985,$_session[user] is not a valid syntax.,0
3986,previously your query was invalid because $_session[user] was a string and needed to be quoted.,0
3987,with prepared statements this is handled for you.,0
3988,the reason why the edit button is always getting the last post is because you are overriding the content variable in the session on each loop.,0
3990,"if this does not exists, i would strongly recommend making a change in your table as it will simplify your process.",0
3993,"if you look at the manual for get_result , it does indeed say it needs the mysqlnd extension:",0
3995,this does not appear to need the additional extension.,0
3996,"there are some examples on how to do this, in the php manual here .",0
3997,i guess the benefit of get_result is that you can read columns without binding them.,0
3998,you should be able to enable that in your php.ini - perhaps it is commented out by default?,0
3999,"i've not personally used mysqli as i've seen, from helping on stack overflow, a number of people get frustrated with the api.",0
4000,i've always used pdo/mysql and see no reason to switch.,0
4001,"it may be worth giving it a try, to see if you prefer it.",0
4002,"instead you should move the parameters outside the quoted string and prepend spaces to them using concat , for example",0
4003,"if the size data is always in the format an integer followed by a space followed by an alphabetic unit, it may not be necessary to use the replace function at all.",0
4004,"if you expressly bind your minimum_size and maximum_size values as integers, mysql will cast the columns to integers as well to do the comparison.",0
4005,you should consider improving the data model.,0
4006,at the moment your query is going to be quite inefficient.,0
4007,"if you stored the sizes as integers in the database, they would be faster to search especially as you could index the fields.",0
4008,this may be a particular concern if you have a large number of records.,0
4009,"if the records are stored in the database using different units (eg some in square metres, some in square feet) you will only be able to search for some of them at any one time using the replace syntax, and you will get incorrect results using pdo::param_int .",0
4010,"a better approach would be to convert all the sizes to one unit before saving them in the database, then convert the user's request to the same unit as necessary.",0
4011,you can remove tags into first sql query use replace function ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replace.html ).,0
4012,you do not need exec str_replace x 8 for every row.,0
4013,to second step you can use one query only with use join to get all data from two tables.,0
4014,there's several ways to make classes work together but it's not clear what you're trying to do.,0
4015,here's some general help and maybe this will get you going in the right direction.,0
4018,it makes your class more generic and flexible.,0
4019,"on the page you want to display differently to each user, check $_session['currentuser'] and then redirect:",0
4020,you may want to read the php.net documention on session_start() .,0
4022,"after that, you have access to the global $_session[] array which you can use to store and read data.",0
4024,you can directly use array_merge or if you want using your method only then replace your code with,0
4025,in your code one closing bracket was missing and merge data store varible was missing which i have added,0
4026,there is simpler solution to do it.,0
4029,i would check the url/api you are connecting to be sure its a proper json.,0
4030,"as for the code itself you've supplied, its correct for calling a function within a class.",0
4031,"this means that if the user variable is not set inside the session, it will redirect to login.php .",0
4033,password and username are case sensitive.,0
4035,while on the php side you need to make sure that you are sending back a json encoded string.,0
4036,"so a var_dump($jsondata_send); would be in order, if it's all right, print it out along with the headers.",0
4044,you are doing an assignment instead of comparison.,0
4047,"also, you cannot have code after the header(""location:$url) ; you need to move the update statement prior to this function and add an exit; after the header function.",0
4051,$_get is not availible when you are running a script via commandline (php-cli).,0
4052,"just because to tell a little bit more: in this specific case a mysqli -result is (more or less -- i don't know the exact details) a pointer to a result ""somewhere else"".",0
4053,"cloning would mean, that two pointers referes to the same result ""somewhere else"", what again will probably lead to severe side effects, because fetching results from one result will definitely affect the other one.",0
4054,you have obvious error in your code.,0
4055,you are missing quotes in {$_session['selpid']} and you are using quotes in column name.,0
4057,"if you have excluded 0 as a valid number for your integer id, you can simply do the following:",0
4059,"if you then need to actually validate the input more strictly, you can turn it back into a string for comparison reasons:",0
4061,"in your example, you can access $somevar directly from somescript.php (you could also directly access $_post or anything else).",0
4062,you may want to check $pstmt-&gt;rowcount() to see if the number of affected rows matches your expectation.,0
4063,that will give you the query string at the end.,0
4065,strpos could return 0 or false and when you use == then zero is like false,0
4066,"also, use strict comparison ( === vs == ), as meeting could be at the start of the string, and then strpos() would return 0 , which would evaluate to false (which would be wrong in that case).",0
4067,your debian server won't be able to use sqlsrv_ functions.,0
4068,if you need to connect to sql server from linux you can use the pdo_dblib library .,0
4070,"you'll have to use a pdo_dblib dsn in your connection string, which might begin with sybase: , mssql: , or dblib: (depending on how php was compiled).",0
4071,it looks like debian packages may use the sybase: prefix .,0
4074,if you want to use session first assign session a value like this :,0
4075,and when you want to access get it like this :,0
4077,"this is the clean, proper, and secure way to do it:",0
4078,"if you are not using a wrapper for running your db queries with prepared parameterized statements, you should use at least mysql_real_escape_string() to remove the nasty stuff in order to prevent sql injection.",0
4079,"as noted by others header() will do a get request, hence why you are not getting the $_post[void] on the page you are redirecting.",0
4080,"that's why you will use variables on your url to transfer them to the redirected page, and then fetch them with $_get .",0
4081,$_post[somename] and $_post['somename'] are two different things.,0
4082,"they will work, because php will try to see if there is a constant named somename , if there isn't one, you are lucky, but if there is one, then all sky falls down.",0
4083,"and as mysqli already supports prepared statements, why not utilize them instead, because as of right now, you are vulnerable to sql injection.",0
4088,you need to us in_array() here:,0
4089,"and as fred pointed out, it won't work anyway until you fix your mixing of mysql and mysqli functions.",0
4090,please read the manual on how to use mysqli_query: http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.query.php .,0
4091,the correct way to use it is:,0
4092,"first of all, the correct way to escape output is htmlentities , not htmlspecialchars .",0
4094,this is pretty much all you have to do to escape xss attacks.,0
4095,you may also consider using strip_tags where it's appropriate.,0
4096,"html entity encoding is okay for untrusted data that you put in the body of the html document, such as inside a tag.",0
4097,"it even sort of works for untrusted data that goes into attributes, particularly if you're religious about using quotes around your attributes.",0
4100,you must use the escape syntax for the part of the html document you're putting untrusted data into.,0
4101,that's what the rules below are all about.,0
4102,the correct way to use htmlspecialchars is something like this:,0
4103,"if you don't wrap in quotes the value attribute, you'd get something like:",0
4104,"having these things in mind, you should be covered for most of the cases.",0
4105,"however, if you want to be really picky, do read the owasp document i mentioned before, it's really helpful.",0
4107,none of them support this encoding.,0
4108,as you can read in some of the comments of the so posts provided at the bottom of the post:,0
4109,solution : don't use utf-7 and also make sure that escaping is done using the same character encoding that the document is being served as to avoid disappearing quotes: establish in the header of your webpage the same encoding as the one you'll use in htmlspecialchars (utf-8 for instance):,0
4111,"use it when there is no need to encode all characters which have their html equivalents, it's better to use htmlspecialchars due to the fact that sends less code to the client.this isn't a matter to be taken lightly: less code sent, faster web pages.",0
4112,code is also more readable than the one produced by htmlentities.,0
4114,when there is a need to encode all characters.,0
4115,if your pages use encodings such as ascii or latin-1 instead of utf-8.,0
4116,i've never liked array_push() and never use it.,0
4118,but that's probably not what you want.,0
4119,i always go with $array[] or $array['key'] syntax.,0
4120,the mysqli library is not a direct drop-in replacement for the older mysql one (note the lack of an i ).,0
4121,use post for your credentials form.,0
4125,"you shouldn't have the login and the upload interface in the same script, otherwise you will have major problems scaling up your application.",0
4126,"as you add pages, it will be almost impossible to know which part of the script should run and using which parameters and outputting what html you will need to pass a ""state"" to the page so that you internally know what the user is trying to do - spreading the logic over multiple php files would make it easier to do.",0
4127,"the file will grow a lot, making it harder for you to understand what's actually getting executed, making it harder for you to debug if you ever start working with other developers, it would be more ""developer friendly"" to break the features in separate php files to minimize conflicts when editing the files",0
4128,a lot of web applications will be split in multiple pages (often implemented in a controller ) where you would have the following:,0
4131,if you ever need to update back the html output into the database.,0
4132,"i suggest you to create a header.php, where you initiate the html to the start of the body tag and add the css files to the html there.",0
4134,i hope this will solve your problem.,0
4136,"instead of writing in a single line, you can break it instead and return the value.",0
4138,"this is not correct.so, it should be something like:",0
4142,"the problem i see is if you had written a wrapper for pdo, then you would have to somehow handle this separately.",0
4143,the answer i had found and loved was write your query and concat the % to the parameter.,0
4144,"""where column like concat('%', :something, '%')""",0
4145,"more than likely you are not unsetting the variables you set in the last element, they are remembered throughout the view.",0
4146,try unsetting items after the first call -,0
4147,like the comment said though if this doesn't work we would need to see your element itself to diagnose the problem.,0
4148,"if you go into your element itself at the end of everything being processed, unset the array housing all the items you are displaying.",0
4149,run your queries one by one.,0
4151,it's no use to ask people what's wrong with your database - they cannot know.,0
4153,"michael suggested that you need to put something left of the = in your if statement, like",0
4154,"however, this may be the source of errors: the condition here is not the value of isset , but whether the assignment was successful or not.",0
4155,so this will jump into the if block whenever the assignment was successful.,0
4156,"since you most probably want to jump into the if block if $content_width has been assigned a value, the statement in your case should read:",0
4157,"also, it's a very common question, for example here you can get a realy clear explanation of how to overcome this notice.",0
4158,"this will never return true, because the values in your select input in your html code are not the keys of $array, but the values.",0
4160,so array_key_exists will always return false in that line of code.,0
4161,"that means the else-block will be executed, which will cause ""error"" to be printed.",0
4162,"did you mean to use in_array($_post[""location""], $array) ( php manual ) instead, maybe?",0
4163,"also, you don't need an else after a die() statement, as the program has stopped.",0
4164,you can leave your structure like:,0
4165,i think you need to wrap your variables in quotes if they are strings:,0
4166,take a look at your code.,0
4167,"if you're having an issue with a query, echo it to the screen.",0
4168,"in your case (just by looking at your code), the query you pass ( $statement ) looks like this:",0
4169,"in php, you can define a string over multiple lines in order to avoid such mistakes.",0
4171,take a look at this overview to learn more about pdo.,0
4172,what you could do is simply add the $_post into a database (mysql) (just make sure to sanitize it all).,0
4173,"if the user wants to edit a post they could simply just add an edit button which loads, say a textarea, with the value of that post (the one stored inside the database).",0
4174,from here you can just adjust the values needed to make the proper post.,0
4176,your main problem is making a json response by concatenating strings.,0
4177,in such case you miss required encodings/escaping and so on.,0
4178,"so, first of all you should create an associative array and then do $json_arr = $_get['callback'].'('.json_encode($your_json_like_array).",0
4179,')'; exactly like in the else clause.,0
4185,"that means variables assigned a "" "", 0, ""0"", or false are set, and therefore are true for isset.",0
4188,"if you do not select any checkbox then you will not get $_post['fruit_list'], array index fruit_list does not exist in array",0
4190,"$_post array does not contain $_post['fruit_list'] 2. first answer is "" no "".a variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false.",0
4191,empty() does not generate a warning if the variable does not exist.,0
4192,"empty checks if the variable is set and if it is it checks it for null, """", 0, etc.",0
4193,"isset just checks if is it set, it could be anything not null.",0
4194,andreas suggests that you need to do an assignment = rather than testing for equality with == .,0
4195,"this is correct, and i think the reason your code doesn't work.",0
4197,"note that i have also used the same technique as kanishka , so you can access the values as $_post['productid'] .",0
4198,blindly concatenating strings together may lead to syntax violations if the strings are supposed to follow a special syntax.,0
4199,"at best this is an annoyance, at worst a security problem.",0
4200,all the different functions are escaping values properly for different syntaxes:,0
4201,"if you database doesn't have it's own function in php, you could use: addslashes() , but it's not recommended to use when you have something specific that is better (mysql_real_escape_string()).",0
4202,a lot of info is also available here on stack overflow.,0
4213,"never use it, but htmlspecialchars() .",0
4214,for printing untrusted user input into browser.,0
4215,mysql_real_escape_string is mysql database specific function.,0
4216,here is a comprehensive guide i wrote exactly on topic where to use it and where not and what else you need to know on mysql database security addslashes().,0
4218,not exactly an answer but i think you might also consider php data objects (pdo) http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php and pdo for mysql http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php,0
4220,"you can tell the mysqli_connect or mysqli::__construct to use persistent connection, if you prefix your hostname with 'p:'",0
4221,the browser interprets the text between &lt; and > as an html tag (at least the ones that don't start with a digit).,0
4222,"if you look at the source of your page, i'm sure you'll find the complete text.",0
4223,"ignoring the problematics of opening files directly from the $_get array for a moment, you need to turn the brackets into html entities.",0
4226,"if you are only using the code for your own use then okay, but even so it may cause problems that you have not thought about.",0
4228,you have a return; statement that wont run your function fsaveipuserlog() you are also using.,0
4230,"this one will test the mysqli extension, if it's available:",0
4232,you need to use parametrized queries.,0
4233,how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
4235,$_server['http_referer'] is the full url that led to the page that checks it.,0
4236,"it's not guaranteed to be set, though it's the only way to know what you're looking for.",0
4238,here is the full reference to the $_server superglobal array.,0
4239,"you should check the keys, especially those starting with http_ .",0
4240,"you could, for clarity, use one file per ajax action, and put them all in the same directory, like /ajax/logout.ajax.php , /ajax/login.ajax.php etc.",0
4241,if you only have a couple of actions you can just use one file to serve them all.,0
4244,try to separate your explode for the next line and explode for the white space.,0
4246,so it would be a nested loop by then.,0
4248,"in you php code, you are not executing the insert query.",0
4249,you need to do something like this:,0
4252,you should look into how to use bound parameters.,0
4253,"you're already using pdo, but you're still writing user-entered code in your sql, and bound parameters avoid that - it would also have avoided this problem, too.",0
4256,i spent ages looking for the answer for a similar problem.,0
4257,"it wasn't an issue with the code or the setup, as a very similar code worked perfectly in another .php on the same server.",0
4258,turned out the problem was caused by a very large amount of data being saved into the session in this page.,0
4261,"with time, the 20 elements turned into 150 and 1000 rows turned into 17000, so the code was storing close to 64 meg of data into the session.",0
4262,"apparently, with this amount of data being stored, it refused to store anything else.",0
4263,"once we changed the code to deal with data locally without saving it into the session, everything worked perfectly.",0
4265,you may also need to change a few session code snippets in application_top.php - creating objects where none exist in the tep_session_is_registered(...) calls (e eg.,0
4266,"navigation object), set $http_ variables to the newer $_server ones and a few other isset tests for empty objects (google for info).",0
4267,i ended up being able to use the original sessions.php files (includes/classes and includes/functions) with a slightly modified application_top.php to get things going again.,0
4268,"the php.ini settings were the main problem, but this of course depends on what your server company has installed as the defaults.",0
4269,you have to concat the value with the two other parts of the string and it's $_post instead of $post :,0
4272,you also don't need to use parenthesis when you use echo (doesn't harm though...).,0
4274,"in order to keep a list of the failures, we must first turn all the elseif's to if's.",0
4275,then we are going to collect the errors in an array.,0
4276,when using the [] operator this just means add this to the end of the current array.,0
4277,"in your case, it would be something along the lines of:",0
4278,"php is separate from js, but you can 'echo' to javascript from php the same way you would normally do with html.",0
4280,you make a ajax call to get the value from a php file,0
4282,"i can't remember how mysqli parses them and when they're bound, but logically it makes more sense in code to set them first then bind anyway.",0
4283,in your case before header.php line 11 is being executed.,0
4284,"load the javascript at the bottom of the page and have the php file (ie jscommentscallback.php ) hit your $url , using $_get['id'] .",0
4285,"if you need to do something with the content of update_comments.php , you can package it up in json and send it back to the browser to insert into the page or whatever.",0
4286,"you are only splitting on spaces, but you want to also split on the comma to remove them.",0
4287,because explode is splitting the string on the spaces - you didn't tell it to do anything with the commas.,0
4288,"because your separator in the explode function is "" "" (space).",0
4291,later you can split it once to get first name and last name separately:,0
4292,"but in my personal opinion, instead of binding all these names and surnames to different variables.",0
4293,put them into an array and print the names by iterating over the array.,0
4294,"then, note, you should use json_decode on one really json string!",0
4295,"you should decode url data variable(result of $this->_getparam('data','')) and then pass it to json_decode!",0
4298,you need to pass connection link to mysqli_error() function like the error says.,0
4299,"keep in mind that for a post (unless using ajax calls), a refresh of the page is required.",0
4301,"the following expression does a string ""subtraction"" to find the common path.",0
4302,"you have a known prefix (document root), an unknown (the root folder) and a known suffix (the script path), so to find the first two, you take the full absolute path ( __file__ ) and subtract the known suffix:",0
4303,therefore you will not be able to access your $_session variables.,0
4304,"apart from this there's a lot of things awfully wrong in your logic, i mean:",0
4306,make sure your html form does hold a post method and that all inputs bear the name attributes and no typos.,0
4307,"using error reporting, will signal that.",0
4308,your present code is open to sql injection .,0
4312,"having said that, your query is incorrect.",0
4314,"you should instead, select the string literals you are trying to insert along with the one value you'd like to select.",0
4315,"if my comment above is wrong, and your question is literally ""how do i pass data from a url to a php script"", the answer is that you use the $_get superglobal variable to access query strings in the standard format .../path/to/script.php?var1=value1&amp;var2=value2...",0
4316,so the url http://amjad-test.site40.net/arabictest.php?username=imsop will execute 'arabictest.php' and populate the variable $_get['username'] with the value 'imsop' .,0
4319,i am assuming you are receiving undefined notice if so please fallow one of these steps.,0
4321,"i hope this is what you intended, its not totally obvious from your code.",0
4323,your code is in serious danger of sql injection.,0
4324,pdo's lastinsertid (and mysql's last_insert_id to which your pdo delegates the call in this case) gives the last autogenerated id on a per-connection basis .,0
4325,concurrent connections will not compromise the integrity of the returned id.,0
4326,"and as you mention in your comment, transactions have no bearing on this.",0
4328,but it can never return an id from another user's query.,0
4329,"you're trying to access the first object in your array, $comments[0] .",0
4330,"since that it is object, and your data property is private, you cannot access it in smarty.",0
4331,you would have to edit the modcomments_commentsmodel class to give you access to either the data property or the crmid key of the property.,0
4332,i'm not sure why you can't use explode to split on commas.,0
4334,"however, a regex like this should work:",0
4335,i posted the following answer because this is what i feel is the solution to the problem.,0
4336,your password column's length is likely to be too short (less than 60) and you would need to do the following and in the order shown:,0
4337,"do make sure that you have data to start with, being a hash and not a plain text password (and other relevant data to query the database), and that the column types are correct, including the length for the email column, or any other for that matter.",0
4338,password_default - use the bcrypt algorithm (default as of php 5.5.0).,0
4339,note that this constant is designed to change over time as new and stronger algorithms are added to php.,0
4340,"for that reason, the length of the result from using this identifier can change over time.",0
4341,"therefore, it is recommended to store the result in a database column that can expand beyond 60 characters (255 characters would be a good choice).",0
4342,i don't see the need for global $mysqli; .,0
4343,that is mostly used when a custom function is introduced.,0
4344,"if you are not using a custom function, it can safely be removed.",0
4345,"however, if you are using a custom function, you have failed to post it in your question.",0
4346,"the mysql api connection is also unknown, so make sure you did establish a successful connection with the mysqli_ api.",0
4347,"as far as i see, self::get_by_query will never work cos it is not defined as static function.",0
4348,1- you can define it so: public static function get_by_query opt.,0
4349,2- you can call it so: $this-&gt;get_by_query,0
4350,"preg_match(""#5#"", ""#51#;#55#"") returns true because preg_match uses # as delimiter.",0
4351,in order to match #5# you have to add delimiters around the regex:,0
4353,it returns the boolean false if it cannot find the string or an integer number that represents the position of the searched string into the other string.,0
4355,you have to compare using === or !== to avoid this.,0
4356,this means the regex in #5# is: 5 .,0
4357,"and this regex , of course, matches any 5 it finds in the string.",0
4358,to fix it you have to surround your regex with some delimiter ( / is usually used):,0
4359,you run your queries with the same variable $sql .,0
4360,you should call them differentely like that and call them after.,0
4364,"you did require_once config.php, which means, it will only be included once (in the first condition) you did close the mysqli connection on the first condition, so mysqli is not accessible anymore after that.",0
4365,"you should not close the connection in the first condition, so you can reuse it in the second condition (tabs).",0
4366,good practice is to close the connection on the end of the file.,0
4368,iterate if you want to apply it to an arbitrary length.,0
4369,"so, date_format doesn't look right at all.",0
4370,"it should be ""yyyymmdd't'hh:mm:ssp,"" or something like that, in php date formatting lingo (i quoted the t, since it's the literal 't' and not a timezone abbreviation).",0
4372,"i would probably check with the people on the appropriate zend list, but at first glance, this looks like something worthy of a bug report.",0
4373,maybe they just don't support checks this particular type of date string yet?,0
4374,and in your function you make some one how this,0
4376,your card_id's are indexed from 1 to n. but comments are indexed from 0.to get comment by card_id you need to use $comment = $_post['comment'][$commentkey]; where $commentkey = $card_id-1;,0
4377,"you are almost correct about what you have said, but if you destroy the session and the script ends in php, thats the time file is deleted.",0
4380,"have a look at your session data in your server, its very interesting.",0
4381,update more interesting things you can do.,0
4382,"now have a look at the session file, it should be deleted after 20 seconds.",0
4384,"so start_session() tries to find the file for the session id in the cookie, and it fails of course, and it just creates a new empty file for that.",0
4385,so your id does not change.,0
4386,"if you really want to change that, try to delete the cookie.",0
4392,"a possible, but not very good, way to fix it would be:",0
4393,"but then you are open to sql injection, since anyone could just post any character to break your query.",0
4394,"what if a password contains a ; , or worse: a partial sql statement?",0
4396,"but then, still, you are using an outdated, deprecated set of functions to connect and work with mysql.",0
4398,next chapter is sending and storing passwords.,0
4399,"you should do this preferably over https (maybe you do already, i hope so).",0
4401,actually you should not store them encrypted either.,0
4403,here is a random one: serious security: how to store your users' passwords safely,0
4404,setting the return value of isset function in the var replaces original value you posted through browser.,0
4406,"this is not a two dimensional array, it's a one dimensional hash/map.",0
4408,it can be treated like a one dimensional array.,0
4409,"by the way, if you need to ignore the keys for the purposes of iteration, you don't need to use array_values() anyway.",0
4410,"the reason your cookie is always the same as the previous value is because the $_cookie array is populated before your php code runs, it isn't changed if you create a new cookie in your code.",0
4411,i would try to fix your server setup issue but if you can't you can force the session id to be consistent.,0
4412,also if the cookie already exists you don't need to create a new one:,0
4413,"use array_sum() to add the numbers in an array, and use array_map() to apply it to each element of the $campus array.",0
4414,both of them use strtotime to convert your string date representation to the timestamp and then compare timestamps.,0
4415,"pay attention to that fact, that this only shows a concept.",0
4416,"meaning, that this code won't catch parsing errors and strtotime can return false if your date keys are invalid.",0
4417,"in such case, the code won't fail, but the results will be unpredictable.",0
4418,try a loop over the array and then inside the loop use the strpos..(adatpt to you need the strpos evalutation,0
4419,i think you are missing some concatenation dots .,0
4421,there are a lot of redundant calls that you can avoid by saving those return values in local variables.,0
4422,"mind you, to see the html equivalents you have to view source as the browser renders them accordingly.",0
4424,you may not need to mangle the $_post with htmlentities corrections or otherwise.,0
4425,it could be that you're looking at a barebones browser output.,0
4426,"in case you're debugging this by spitting it out with something like print_r( $_post ); die; , make sure that somewhere above it in your page you have a meta line setting your character encoding to utf-8:",0
4427,"first, you have to work with the connection.",0
4428,where $db is a pdo instance with a valid connection.,0
4429,"so, if we have an script to call the functions, it should be like this:",0
4430,so by the looks of the example code i get the impression that you're migrating from the deprecated mysql extension over to pdo.,0
4431,something the mysql extension does that may be tripping you up is that if you don't specify the mysql link resource to mysql_query it uses the lastly created link resource that was created by mysql_connect .,0
4432,once you move to using pdo you're going to have to have the pdo connection available in the user_data and user_active functions.,0
4433,"the simplest approach would be to create a pdo connection in each function, it's terribly repetitive and not a good solution at all, but it works.",0
4435,aside from that you could write the functions like this:,0
4437,"and to show all, just reverse the arrays order",0
4438,"as you are sending an object in your service key, you probably have a multi-dimensional array in $_post['service'] .",0
4439,"if you want to send a string, you should convert the object to json:",0
4440,now you can decode it like you are doing in php.,0
4441,also note that you can only send json back from php if you set the datatype to json .,0
4442,anything other than valid json will have you end up in the error handler.,0
4445,"you can then use this resource to fetch the data, so you would replace",0
4447,you need to learn basic coding culture.,0
4448,you are writing all the stuff twice always check for error do not stack too much code in one line.,0
4449,"make your code distinct, step by step.",0
4451,get the product of this code in a variable and pass it over.,0
4452,do not fold all the program in a single line.,0
4453,this way you'll always know the reason of the problem and have your code run smooth and easier to maintain.,0
4454,also just noted that your way of selecting a database is quite a... strange.,0
4455,"'chat.sql' is a file with table creation code , not database.",0
4457,"as you have been told already, mysql ext is obsoleted.",0
4458,"you have to use use pdo instead, as it's the only choice for php users whose only idea of database interaction is direct calls to api.",0
4459,"strchr() will give you true/false if the character (in your case, ""."")",0
4460,"so to get the file extension, you could use something like:",0
4461,.. but maybe a function like pathinfo() could be usefull in this case too.,0
4462,"furthermore, in your error message you use $extensions .",0
4463,"this is a var with type ""array"", and thus the string representation is ""array"".",0
4464,i think you meant $extension (without the s) there.,0
4465,"or, maybe, you want to list all correct extensions this way: implode(',', $extensions) .",0
4466,note that checking on extensions is not a safe way to check what kind of content is present.,0
4467,"i can easily upload a .exe, by just renaming it to .jpg.",0
4468,are you sure that $ss isset ?,0
4471,all the code that you want run after the if should be contained there.,0
4472,"every time you loop over the array, $t will take the value of each element of the array, which in your case would be an integer.",0
4473,"the problem is that implode() expects the second parameter to be an array, not an integer.",0
4474,"check to see if the session is set (with an optional "" if { equal to something } ""), and if not, else { kick them out } .",0
4475,"the logic is, and to be part of every page using sessions that you wish to protect and assuming $secretcode equals 12345 as an example:",0
4477,"use it once and at the ""top"" of every page, while making sure you're not outputting before header.",0
4480,"you need to use the loop to parse the file into an array, but then you need to sort it (using usort ) outside of the loop.",0
4482,"you're not comparing them with the other elements, so your array_multisort doesn't actually do anything.",0
4483,using str_replace would mean you have to looop through the string and then use the offset of the first s found to decide where and what to replace.,0
4485,"for mysqli, there's mysqli_result-&gt;fetch_fields() , mysqli_result-&gt;fetch_field() and mysqli_result-&gt;fetch_field_direct() .",0
4487,here is a simple class based on mysqli .,0
4489,"of course, add your own error checking as needed.",0
4490,success will return a numerically indexed array of column names from $table.,0
4491,failure or non-string input will return false .,0
4492,if method returns false (var_dump returns bool(false) ) you can check the current error with $mysqlz->error .,0
4494,i'd say it is not a dead end but on purpose.,0
4497,next to that this is also not what the warning precisely wants to tell you.,0
4498,"swapping a superglobal like $_get with an equally superglobal function like filter_input(input_get, ...) shows the same design flaw.",0
4499,but netbeans can't warn you as easily about it.,0
4501,bootstrapping the request information and do not use any superglobals nor the filter_input function in the rest of your code.,0
4502,"the $email variable has to exist on both pages, which means you have to transfer it to the second script somehow, either by $_get or $_session",0
4503,"but since you know it should be an integer, this will get the proper number if it begins with the number or 0 if not:",0
4507,"by default (and unless you have renamed the cookie with the session.name php configuration option ), the name of the cookie is phpsessid .",0
4510,you're seeing $_get['reff']=index.php because your rewrite rule is running twice .,0
4512,it is due to the fact that your uri pattern ^([^/]+)/([^/]+)/?$ matches both uris.,0
4513,to prevent this unwanted behavior you need to have your rule like this:,0
4514,"you can't check $conn-&gt;errno after connect, there is a special property $conn-&gt;connect_errno for that.",0
4515,"also in php, when you don't want any errors or warnings to be generated (e.g.",0
4516,"because you don't care, or because you are handling them yourself like in your case), you are supposed to use the @ error control operator .",0
4517,but that means you are doing the checks yourselves and you are not using exceptions at all!,0
4518,"as explained in the documentation , this makes mysqli "" throw mysqli_sql_exception for errors instead of warnings "".",0
4519,"you don't need the @ operator then, neither the check for errno value:",0
4520,update your code similar to the above and it'll work.,0
4521,do the same with the rest of your queries.,0
4522,"in the future, if you need to encode/decode a url, use urlencode or urldecode instead of str_replace",0
4523,"cakephp ships with an authentication layer, there's little to no need to implement your own.",0
4526,"before throwing code together, read the docs and make sure sure that you understand the apis that you are working with.",0
4527,"as you can see, components do receive a reference of the controller on which they are being used in every callback, so if you need to access controller functionality, you use that reference.",0
4528,"if you need to use it at a later point, store it in a property, like",0
4529,"the session can easily be accessed via the session component that you can include in your custom component, like",0
4530,there is absolutely no relation between pdo and class variables.,0
4532,if $row is a result of a query you need to specify a column like $_session['permission'] = $row[column_name];,0
4533,you are assigning the row array to the $_session['permission'] variable so when you print it you get array.try using print_r on that array and you'll see what's in it.,0
4535,use print_r or var_dump to find out what's going on when you see this happen again.,0
4536,this allows you to make an ajax call by calling getmodels() .,0
4537,so all you have to do is call it:,0
4538,this way the code is also more testable.,0
4539,this isn't a perfect solution and you should definitely consider using $(function(){}); to make sure the document is ready.,0
4540,"ajax request also needs time to complete, so that models won't be there instantaneously when the page loads.",0
4543,it looks like you are using undfined variables.,0
4544,"as long as you have no value for your checkbox, the variable will not exist.",0
4545,for example when you are browsing to this site for the first time.,0
4546,"it would also be wise to look into replacing all mysql() functions into mysqli or pdo, or a library that makes use of them.",0
4547,the reason you get this output is because you are echoing $finalnum 5 times.,0
4548,the value of $finalnum is not changing.,0
4549,"as andrew already stated, whatever is inside a &lt;select&gt; -tag must be of type &lt;option&gt; .",0
4553,as long as you use the same connection your user variables will remain intact.,0
4554,maybe it would be better to create a view from the generated select statement instead for later re-use.,0
4556,the correct function to use given that input is explode .,0
4560,as long as you are cleaning the input (validation / scrubbing) there is no danger.,0
4561,"to fix it, you need to use the !== operator (the not equal equivalent of === ):",0
4562,"if your intention is to learn how to write sql queries and to create something for your own, use mysqli or pdo.",0
4564,"with 3 pages tutorial, you can do the most general things.",0
4565,however some very special cases are better coded in raw sql than with doctrine.,0
4566,"but if you know how to do things with doctrine it is a very useful library and you end up writing better, consistenter, more readabler and extensiabler (:-)) code.",0
4567,you should inherit from newsform creating a new form (unsetting the fields you like) to be used in the frontend.,0
4568,this way you let the original form with the most fields for use by the admin app.,0
4570,"when you are updating client-side data via jquery, you need to set the value of result to whatever it is that you want to pass through.",0
4571,"you can serialize a js object using jquery.param() , so you can then pass through json-encoded data to php.",0
4572,when processing the post data you would then need to decode the json data in $_post['result'],0
4573,"if i'm reading your sample correctly, your items are std objects instead of arrays.",0
4574,you may need to reference them like this:,0
4576,if you could provide it with the indentation it would be helpful.,0
4577,what helps me in problems like this is to try to print inside the foreach loop.,0
4578,"for example, you can do a var_dump of each $result and see what that structure is, and it could help determine how to proceed.",0
4579,you need to wrap it within quotes.,0
4580,"also, it would be better if you use some debugging along with it.",0
4581,"if more than one file has the same mtime, it will overwrite that file from your $oar array.",0
4582,instead store each value as an array of files to solve that issue.,0
4583,"and this statement return explode("" * "", implode("" * "", $oar )); seems like it can just be replace with return array_values($oar); with the above adjustment i mentioned, you may have to loop over the $oar array and push each set of values to a new array and return that instead.",0
4584,please read mysql functions manual ant php.net.,0
4586,first of all this $codigo= mysql_insert_id(); does nothing unless you have insert query before that.,0
4587,"also, main reason that this script doesn't work is incorrect usage of mysql_fetch_assoc , this function returns associative array so you have to address to the value by key to get it.",0
4588,like this $email=mysql_fetch_assoc($pesquisa)['mail'] .yet again i recommend you to use proper mysql extensions and to find proper guide on mysql in php.,0
4589,create a variable which houses the information form the db.,0
4590,"also i agree with the previous answer, try switching to pdo or mysqli.",0
4591,from the release php 7 later this year mysql_query will be removed.,0
4592,the /* process $_get['images'] to recover the path */ part implies any sanitizing you need to do on the input to avoid that someone requests a forbidden file.,0
4593,"if your script input is a file path, this may mean checking from a predefined list, stripping of possible directory separators, checking against a regex, etc.",0
4594,"another way would be to store paths inside a database and pass the script a simple id, and recover the file path with it.",0
4595,"this might be a better idea, as users will see no mention of any file path on the script url (if you just pass a path, people can actually guess where files are, and that's what you're trying to prevent).",0
4596,it's not working because somewhere in the regex you are asking for a dot in between http:// and / .,0
4597,"http://localhost/whatever has no dot, so it fails.",0
4599,"but a better way would be, when you would prepare your sql string before you execute it.",0
4600,have a look at php pdo mysql connector.,0
4601,there you have some methods to prepare your string.,0
4602,you can use something like this.,0
4603,proper use of isset and proper use of empty function.,0
4604,i'm not sure how you're getting the variable $id though.,0
4606,"if lead_id is a primary key or unique you wont be able to insert it twice, or have multiple lead with the same lead_id .",0
4607,insert and update will only give you one note .,0
4608,also: there is a typo in your form.,0
4609,"in the &lt;input input type=""submit"" value=""submit "" &gt; .",0
4611,you have to use is_empty(); method to find it.,0
4613,"yes, it's possible to use the ternary operator in php.",0
4614,replacing (a == b) with isset(expression) (returns boolean value) should do the trick.,0
4615,just make sure that the = operator doesn't take precedence.,0
4616,it may not be necessary but i'd wrap the ternary statement in between curved brackets.,0
4617,no this is not expected behavior and must be a bug in the pdo pgsql extension.,0
4618,however i looked into it a little bit more.,0
4619,comparing the code from the patch 2 years ago ( source ) and the current code one ( source ) shows that nothing has changed since they patched that error.,0
4620,"at least not in those direct affected functions, and it might also been a slightly different bug back then.",0
4621,so my guess is that there is something else which of course won't help you solve your problem.,0
4622,you could check if your connection has an outstanding transaction.,0
4623,for this you will need to create a second connection when hitting the exception.,0
4624,first off determine your current connection id.,0
4625,in my case it returned the number 19339 .,0
4627,if it returns idle there is no current transaction for that old connection.,0
4628,"if it's one of the upper three, there is a transactions still active.",0
4631,"and even unhandled, they act as regular php errors providing all the important information, following site-wide error reporting settings.",0
4632,"note that setting this mode as a connection option will let pdo throw exceptions on connection errors too, which is very important.",0
4633,"so, here is an example for creating a pdo connection right way:",0
4634,"connecting this way, you will be always notified of all database errors, occurred during query execution.",0
4635,note that you have to be able to see php errors in general.,0
4636,"on a live site you have to peek into error logs, so, settings have to be",0
4637,"presuming id is the primary key, you can use the following function to update on a database level which will prevent race conditions:",0
4638,also note the intval() around the $_get variable to prevent sql injection,0
4639,as the php is expecting a var named uname as per this $_post['uname'] while you were sending username .,0
4640,"so, the simple change is to swap the properties in the object.",0
4641,you are posting to checkusername.php {username: uname} and trying to get $_post['uname'] and in js you don't have the uname variable.change { username: uname } to { uname: username },0
4644,i wrote a quick example to demonstrate this:,0
4645,"this part throws me for a little loop, and i hope someone out there can correct me if i am wrong.",0
4646,__destruct() is being called twice because the object is created and then destroyed when putting it into the session.,0
4647,echoing out the $_session['object']-&gt;myvar reinitiates the object and then is subsequently destroyed.,0
4650,"from looking at your code, it seems like you are not storing your activityeventid in session variable.",0
4652,"as ""clientevent"" table has foreign key constraint for ""activityeventid"" column.",0
4653,"as this constrain will fail, the query will not be executed and you are getting the error.",0
4654,so basically you need to find a way to pass correct value there.,0
4655,"edit: as for your comment, the script that you posted doesn't seem to store 'activityeventid' in the session as the lines you quoted are actually commented on the script that you posted in question.",0
4656,to be specific here is what you need to do.,0
4658,and you can retrieve this in createnewactivitybooking.php as following:,0
4659,"you may need to reformat few things layout wise, but i think this is how it should be done.",0
4662,"$_post is an associative array, so you need to be accessing it using single quotes, for example:",0
4663,this means you will have to use the concatenation operator in your query.,0
4666,just like you did to unset form fields in the older symfony versions (fx unset($this['name'] ).,0
4667,"newer versions have introduced a method usefields($array) , but you can still use the unset function.",0
4668,"as you can see here here , you can use it to unset an array element.",0
4669,and symfony's sfform implements arrayaccess .,0
4672,"so in your case, this would technically work:",0
4674,"one of the results would be: [0,3,6,null,11,null] * which means that gfx was included.",0
4675,you could filter that result if you don't want empty values with,0
4676,'is_int' param is needed only to handle 0 correctly.,0
4677,if 0 is not valid id then you might skip it (and may use 0 instead of null then),0
4678,as your app grows using $_request instead of the appropriate array will most certainly make your documentation a nightmare.,0
4679,using $_request to get $_get or $_post values is just unnecessary.,0
4683,"if you also need to remove it from the array, then you need something like this:",0
4685,"it's great for things like reading from $_get and $_post , but you can use it on any array:",0
4686,"the mysqli class does not have a -&gt;connect() method, and you might be working with a duplicate class name which is never a good idea (this is also the reason you're getting null and can't call the prepare method).",0
4687,you can add new fields to the form if you alter the html code.,0
4688,"there are many different form elements, see if there is something you need here: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp",0
4689,"you can access the value of each element with $_post['key'] , so to add it to the array you would have to write $thisarray[] = $_post['key'] .",0
4690,note: replace key with the actual name of the form element.,0
4691,"i named the field the_new_element , change this to whatever you want.",0
4692,of course you should also sanitzie the contents.,0
4693,if it's realy array_unqiue() i would generate a new array and push the unique numbers in this new one.,0
4694,"you can check if it's already in the new array with in_array(number-to-check, $array) .",0
4695,"if in_array() doesn't return true, add it to the unique-number-array.",0
4696,"there are many logical ways to check that, but one particular function - ctype_digit() - happens to do exactly what you want.",0
4701,"explode , and other functions can't return a fully formed array for immediate use,and so you have to set a temporary variable.",0
4702,"there may be code in the development tree to do that, but the only way to get the elements you need for now, is the temporary variable.",0
4703,"as others have said, php is unlike javascript in that it can't access array elements from function returns.the second method you listed works.",0
4705,"if you would like to remove the slight overhead that explode may cause due to multiple separations, you can set its limit to 2 by passing two after the other arguments.",0
4706,you may also consider using str_pos and strstr instead:,0
4707,edit another way would be to use list() (see php doc ).,0
4708,with it you can grab any element:,0
4711,"there must be a better way to do this, but i have not found it.",0
4712,"in my case i wanted to get the number 188 from the url, and all the rest of the url was static, so i ended up using the substr method, but for a dynamic version where lenth may change, the array_get method above is the fastets and cleanest.",0
4713,"you are executing the query directly by calling $mysqli-&gt;query(...) , the result is a result object of everything found in the database.",0
4715,problem is: the query has already been executed.,0
4716,you have to add strings to the query string before calling query() .,0
4717,"either that or instead of appending to a string, append to an array and use implode .",0
4719,the only odd thing is that the $flags variable was set to be included as one of the parameters for the str_replace function they are actually not used at all; but i don't know if they are really needed.,0
4720,"if i understand you correctly, you want to fetch the data into objects?",0
4721,mysqli has a fetch_object method/function: http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-result.fetch-object.php use it like this:,0
4722,"as @sudhir said, you can use in_array() function in php.",0
4723,this function search your expected item through an array and will return true if it can find it.,0
4724,"so using the code that @sudhir suggested, will work for you as you want.",0
4725,"to know more about in_array() function, see http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php",0
4726,"imo all session data must be managed in the server, if you really need it in the front-end get it asynchronously.",0
4727,"the reason i propose to you this solution is that i think it is better to get the session id dynamically when needed, instead of having it stored in a static way, is that this identifier may be modified, deleted, etc., while the user takes his time to fill a form.",0
4729,"submit a form and instead of being processed, we are redirected to a login page, losing all data sent.",0
4731,"as well, this code was meant to match your code as close as possible, however... a much better way would be to make level an int value, as well using a case with default being the line $query = ""select *,lpad(id,4,'0') as id from students $max""; .",0
4733,"my script above works proper only if your initial translate is set to (0,0).",0
4736,"that is certainly causing you troubles, and will cause you more troubles in the future.",0
4737,"i'm not a database design expert, when i started with programming i was doing the same thing.",0
4738,"i wanted to do something quick and easy, without too much hassle with relationships, and it always turn out into a mess so that eventually had to start over from the beginning, and do it properly.",0
4739,"this design anti-pattern will make querying much more difficult, also, you have to write a lot of code to reinvent the built-in functionality of the database that is lost ( you have already started to do that, strpos("","".$v2['idsroom']."","","","".$v['id'].",0
4740,i took some time to rewrite the example.,0
4741,for the range of dates i use the dateperiod class.,0
4742,"it can be used in foreach loop so it is suitable for calendars, etc.",0
4744,after converting the $bookings array to separate the idsroom values it looks like:,0
4745,"if you're trying to word wrap the images you're constructing, perhaps you could put them all in individual div's in order with the float:left style.",0
4746,all of the answers so far make it much more difficult than it is.,0
4747,why not put it back together as you modify it?,0
4748,i think this is what you are looking for.,0
4749,the truncation indicates that it is not utf8.,0
4750,"check show collation like 'cp125%'; if you don't see cp1252, then latin1 is probably what you need.",0
4751,"i'd recommend pdo, because if you change to a different db at a later day, or if you wish to use a different db in another project, then at least you won't have to learn another api, since pdo supports a lot of the more popular dbmss.",0
4753,"my guess is that it has something to do with your function being recursive, and you are returning the array reversed with array_reverse.",0
4754,"when it gets to the end, the array is reversed and php is having trouble reconstructing the original array.",0
4760,if you want to rewrite the entire database logic i recommend you to give a try to doctrine2 orm .,0
4761,it is really powerful and handle a lot of dbm (through pdo or custom connectors in order to support mongodb in example).,0
4762,"by tailing the log, you should be able to see the exact query that was submitted.",0
4763,"one final note, i notice you're using a fixed salt value.",0
4764,wouldn't it be better to generate this value randomly each time you need it and then store it in the users table?,0
4765,"generally, a salt is not intended to be secret, it's just there to prevent people precomputing tables of passwords using the hash algorithm that you use.",0
4766,xml parsers understand the xml specification.,0
4769,also variable $view contains result of pdostatement::fetch(pdo::fetch_assoc) and it is an array with key post_views so you should change the code to:,0
4770,or if you want to spare one sql query executed you can just call this:,0
4773,however as you are fetching an assoc you could just change your foreach loop to this:,0
4774,"there may be other issues, have you tried using print_r on the result of each pdo function call to check at what point it is failing?",0
4775,"as far as preventing duplicates, insert ignore should stop that provided you have a good pk set.",0
4776,"otherwise you can run a select quick query to check if any rows exist, then do an if test around the prepared insert saying something like if($numrows == 0) then insert.",0
4777,this i sent will also show a successful submit message,0
4778,you appear to build up the sql at the start but only ever use the first element of the checks input array.,0
4780,i would advise you to swap over.,0
4781,this would also allow you to use parameterised queries which are safer.,0
4782,your current query is wide open to sql injection attacks.,0
4783,add hidden fields to your form.,0
4785,first this do see what you are getting in the $row within the foreach by using the print_r() .,0
4787,you missed one ' at the end.,0
4789,they are no longer maintained and are officially deprecated .,0
4791,"if you choose pdo, here is a good tutorial .",0
4792,"as others have mentioned you can't read it, without parsing the output of var_dump .",0
4794,put it in the cillosis wayand it should be faster.,0
4795,you have an array with all possible values.,0
4796,you have an array with actual provided values.,0
4797,you want to know whether there are values provided that are not in the array with all possible values.,0
4799,the call to array_diff gives you all items in $all_barristers_faves that do not occur in $allfavourites.,0
4800,"when the count of these items is 0, you can be sure that all 'skills' are in 'faves'.",0
4801,"i would suggest for u to turn the in_array($all_barristers_faves[$i], $allfavourites) to in_array($all_barristers_faves[$i], $allfavourites, false); .perhaps the 18 is taken as a different type in one of the arrays.",0
4802,by putting the third parameter to false it does not check for same type.,0
4803,"i am not sure about the pdo part, but to write it to a file you would do something like this",0
4804,"well, the most reliable would to use array_search which would eliminate your whole function -",0
4808,you could check if the return value is false|null at the place you call this function.,0
4809,i would do return $key ??,0
4810,here's how you can do with the last array you have given.,0
4811,"just for academic reasons, i think you could still have used array_diff to arrive at the same result (i.e.",0
4813,"as a basic rule, to figure out where the error is, break it down to it's basic pieces.",0
4814,"in your case, look at what drives that specific error.",0
4815,in this case it is because of this line if ( !empty($result) ) .,0
4816,you instructed it to print that message if this isn't the case; it's coming from your else statement.,0
4817,this means that $result is empty.,0
4818,"if it's not empty, you need to figure out why.",0
4819,"in this particular instance it appears that you don't appear to be doing any kind of row count in your query, so by default, it will show as empty.",0
4820,you can get a row count by doing something like this (using your code example):,0
4823,and ensure session's values are returned correctly:,0
4825,"instead, you have to use the break keyword.",0
4826,what is &lt;&gt; doing in php code?,0
4829,your example shows line-breaks within the strings.,0
4830,"depending on platform, those can vary.",0
4832,you can easily validate this by making the binary sequence of the strings you operate with visible by creating hexdumps of them:,0
4833,"in fact, you don't even have to use preg_replace here, if each param=value string begins from a new line; str_replace(""\n"", '&amp;') should do the trick.",0
4834,"here you first create an array of 'key-value pair' strings, then split each element by = : the first part would be the key, the second - the value.",0
4835,you can use the regular expression reported by @raina77ow or you could use explodes (riskier):,0
4836,"you can achieve this by setting a cookie / session variable, which tells you the form was already processed.",0
4838,so i finally solved it with this:,0
4839,the 0 you are getting is not false it is because the targeted value is the first value of your string.,0
4843,that is because you are overwriting the variable $cartoutput each time your foreach loop runs.,0
4844,so that means that only the last element of your cart is visible.,0
4845,"you can remedy this by either appending to $cartoutput or by making it an array, and imploding it afterwards.",0
4846,alternatively you can also just append all output to the already existant output in $cartoutput like so:,0
4847,assuming the result of the first explode is in $my_first_array (for clarity) and so for $my_second_arraythe you could use a foreach over the two array checking for isset values,0
4848,"i guess there's no way to automatically explode it to multi-dimension array, so you have to write your specific algorythm to do the job.there is a logical sequence in the string so it can easilly be transformed.",0
4849,"start with exploding by ""@"", then for each element explode by ""a%"", and then by ""|"".",0
4850,if i understood your question correctly you have the entry in your database but it is not shown on your page until you make another post.,0
4852,"if you add a bit of php code (for example: header(""location: $_server['request_uri']""); ) to manually refresh the page after a post you should see it right away.",0
4853,hi i think you messed up on your line 3 mail script.,0
4854,"if (isset($_post['name'], $_post['mail'], $_post['text'])) { because you will use comparison operators for that.",0
4857,"by doing this: produk::where('jumlah_stok', 0) you're getting a query builder object.",0
4858,"i assume you want one single record, so you should do: produk::where('jumlah_stok', 0)-&gt;first()",0
4859,"when you try to use your variable in your view, you use double brackets ( {{$stok}} ).",0
4860,"laravel will sanitize this input, and try to force it through htmlspecialchars() , which won't work, because htmlspecialchars() expects a string, and right now, you're feeding it a query builder object.",0
4861,"if you wish to use unsanitized variables in your views, use this syntax: {!!",0
4862,"even if you were to update both of the previous things, you'd most likely still not end up with the wanted result, since you'll echo a collection to a view.",0
4864,"would also work, but it'd be unsanitized).",0
4865,"correct or not, you can do it easier and safer.",0
4868,"as an alternative, you can make the operation more concise using array_map() :",0
4870,the problem may be that your query returns nothing when there is no corresponding entry of the value $_session['uname'] stored in unme column in regst table.,0
4874,but i have to mention that naming the variable should be done better to avoid confusion.,0
4875,make some effort in naming the variable to decrease the errors in your code.,0
4876,also you have to use another way for connecting and querying the database.,0
4878,"i don't think security is going to be effected, simply because this is a url, being printed to a browser... the worst that can happen is exposing the full directory path to the file, and potentially creating a broken link.",0
4881,what happens if the path does not match the 'document_root')...,0
4882,"on my websites, i simply have a variable defined at the beggining of script execution which sets:",0
4883,"do exactly the same thing: put a record (row) from a query into an array, using field names as indexes.",0
4884,"this way it's easy to use the data, because you can use field names (with a little bit around them) for displaying or manipulating the field values.",0
4885,it checks if there is a row still to fetch from the query results.,0
4886,"and while there is one - it puts it into the array $row for you to use, and repeats (all the stuff between { and }).",0
4890,"in the first query you want the header only, and there is no additional table needed in your example, so you should have just",0
4891,"whereas in the second query i understand you have a table parts, which contains descriptions of various parts that can be ordered?",0
4892,"if so, then the second query should have:",0
4893,"if in your orders table you had a field for the id of the supplier supplier_id , pointing to a suppliers table, and an id of the person placing the order customer_id , pointing to a customers table, then the first query would look like this:",0
4894,will return true if mysqli will successfully close the connection.,0
4895,"so you are not checking if the connection is closed, but you are closing the connection with success.",0
4896,"you are connecting twice to the database, but only closing the connection once.",0
4897,normally you will store the connection in property and reuse the connection and then close it at the end of the calls or script.,0
4898,"you could be the victim of bots, or some joker visiting your site ever so often just to tick you off.",0
4899,sidenote: || checks to see if one or any are empty.,0
4900,then check if the button is set and that the inputs are not empty:,0
4902,"you could add a checkbox to your form to check if it was checked or not, and handle it with a conditional statement.",0
4903,"note: you can also compare the cookie value by adding the extra comparison on the query, like and b.userid=$_cookie[""id""] (better to save the cookie value in a variable)",0
4904,i did a few things in the source.,0
4906,here is a list of things i added:,0
4913,you can access a specific index of the array this way:,0
4915,"and you can just keep using var_dump as you already are, but put that die inside an if statement like this",0
4917,"and to retain the selections after a failed page submit, you need to change:",0
4918,"after you process the $_post data, use a select query followed by an if statement to check if there are any rows in the table with the same first name and last name as the $_post first name and last name data.",0
4921,make the column this key goes into te primary key.,0
4922,then you use an insert ignore and you can ignore any errors.,0
4923,then you run a select on the $key to return everything related to $key and display any info you have on the user in a friendly format.,0
4924,"you don't have to show the user an error at that point, simply provide them with the info already captured.",0
4925,if you are worried about users with the same name seeing each other's data then the data can be obfuscated.,0
4926,for example instead of showing a phone number (333) 444-5555 you show (333) 444-5* 5 or (333) * *-5555. something that gives the user enough info to know if it is them or someone else with the same name.,0
4927,"in your query you need to have your php variables outside the string, otherwise they will be parsed as text (ex: ""$title"") instead of the actual values of the variable:",0
4929,along with this as @bhttoan pointed out.,0
4931,"instead of using file+implode, use file_get_contents you cannot use array_diff here since it compares the contents of the array, not the particular order as you need it have a look at pear's text_diff for creating textual diffs.",0
4933,you should probably use scandir() or equivalent php functions that are specifically made for this.,0
4934,"alternatively, you could just iterate over the part you want with a for loop instead of a foreach loop.",0
4935,"as i have stated in my answer to your question on wpse, you will need to get your posts sorted by the date in your custom field.",0
4936,this is as easy as adding the correct parameters to your query arguments,0
4937,all you need is to add the correct values to the order and orderby parameters.,0
4938,"if you need to sort by month regardless of year, then you would need to use usort() to sort your loop before executing it.",0
4940,"all you need to do now is to check the dates (months) between the current post in the loop against the previous post in the loop, and if they differ, output the month.",0
4941,"you don't need a foreach loop, neither do you need output buffering or creating a new array with posts from the original array of posts",0
4942,"the following code is untested, also, make sure that date format in your custom field is correct.",0
4943,"inside your loop you would want to first do var_dump( get_post_meta( $post-&gt;id, '_edate', true ) ); to verify that you get the correct value in the correct format.",0
4945,"if the value or format is incorrect in your _edate custom field, my code will fail.",0
4947,i have fixed the code above and tested it.,0
4948,everything is working now as expected.,0
4949,please see the comments in the code for the bugs fixed,0
4952,unset is ok for the purpose.,0
4954,in addition you have all functions with mysql_* they also need some care.,0
4955,"if you don't want to use a foreach , you can use a combination of array_keys , array_map , and array_combine to achieve this.",0
4956,"as @wrikken pointed out, the use of array_values is redundant and not needed.",0
4957,you forgot to specify the database you want to connect to as the last parameter,0
4958,"so, in your original script, you were connecting with mysqli_connect but then using mysql_select_db... this is where the error was coming from - the mysql_select_db.",0
4959,"if you change the call to mysqli_select_db([conn id], [db name]) that particular error will resolve itself.",0
4960,"but, you can also bypass the need for the additional call by passing the dbname with the initial mysqli_connect(..).",0
4961,i recommend taking a look at this page which provides you with a nice example of how to properly use the mysqli connector.,0
4962,it will make your life much easier and you will be able to properly see the errors mysql throws if any occur.,0
4963,so i'm not actually sure what you are trying to do.,0
4964,if you are trying to add headers that start with x from your request to your response then i would use this in your htaccess file.,0
4965,"if you are trying to use header values in your php script then they should be in your $_server array, but the names are normalized.",0
4966,it sounds like you want to get the values from a dynamic number of headers that start with x. if this is the case then your code won't work either way.,0
4967,your code (if it worked) would always contain the last value of a header that starts with x. so if you have more than 1 header that starts with x then you would be missing values.,0
4968,"using your code, you would need to create a rule for each header that you wanted to pass to your php script, which sounds like a pain.",0
4969,"however, you can still use $_get[""profile""] while it has a null value in your script without it generating a notice.",0
4971,you you can use the function addslashes() to escape those values before inserting them.e.g,0
4973,"a better method would be to explode $dservices into another array, instead of using strpos .",0
4974,check if you have magic quotes turned on and make sure you turn them off .,0
4978,try changing those lines in add.php.,0
4980,"it's a little tricky, though - it's going to be the script that runs that code, which may or may not be the one loaded directly by the browser.",0
4982,"if you want to arrive somewhere else, you probably want to set the action of the form to be something besides this ""current script"" value.",0
4984,"to see what i mean, look at the rendered code of the index.php page.",0
4985,"you will see that the form tag renders with action=""add-album.php"" or something similar.",0
4986,that's why add-album.php loads when you submit.,0
4987,you may find that setting the action with a static value is what you want.,0
4988,you left out one important detail - where do you want to send the form data?,0
4992,if you do htmlentities on it when you save then you have to do html_entity_decode on the text when the user wants to edit the input.,0
4993,so you sanitize for what you need and nothing more.,0
4996,"also, i am not sure if you saw darryl hein's comment, but you really do not want magic_quotes enabled.",0
4997,"they are a bad, bad, thing and have been deprecated as of php 5.3 and will be gone altogether in php 6.",0
4999,this replaces any need to use mysql_real_escape_string() .,0
5000,try using mysqli::multi_query() instead of mysqli::query() .,0
5001,it allows the execution of multiple queries at once.,0
5003,so you can use try ... catch block getting exception and process this situation correctly.,0
5004,"only if the storage engine supports transactions (innodb does, myisam does not), and you are not in autocommit mode.",0
5005,this can be easily accomplished without using a regex.,0
5006,"you can use strpos() to find the position of cnt= string, then use substr() to get everything after it (which, in this case, is what you want), and add the values into an array.",0
5007,"once the loop finishes execution, you can simply grab the largest value from the array using max() function.",0
5008,the regular expression needs to be wrapped in valid delimiters and you're not having one in your code.,0
5009,"also, even if there was one, it wouldn't work, because you're only checking if the line contains cnt= string -- which will be true for all the lines in this case.",0
5010,you need to use capturing groups in your regular expression.,0
5011,it would help us answer the question if you provided the error.,0
5012,being that i answered your last question:,0
5014,at the end of your query.,0
5015,i'm guessing that you are using a $_get request or something similar to determine the product id.,0
5016,"maybe this has something to do with your issue, possibly just remove it from the query?",0
5017,"you should only need to use 1 unique key for your sql query, especially as unique as the hash you're creating.",0
5018,"option 1 allows you to re-use the $data variable so you can display the results twice, but the cost of this is that you potentially have a large amount of data stored in a variable.",0
5019,you can clear this by using unset($data) once you are 100% sure you've finished with it.,0
5020,option 2 requires less loops (only one instead of two) and doesn't need a extra variable to store the data.,0
5021,the cost of this is that the while loop can only be used once.,0
5022,i would recommend option 2 providing that you'd only need to use the while loop once.,0
5023,"also, you could benchmark your scripts to see how they perform against one another.",0
5024,one think i spotted was the undeclared $category variable which i assume to be $_get['category']you might wish to perform some better sanitation of user input here.,0
5025,to get the records displayed when the user selects view by category and thus causing the url to become http://localhost/edit.php?category= you should set a test that selects records according to whether $_get['category is empty.,0
5026,"update: since the posting of the db logic and sql, some of the above could be simplified to",0
5028,"instead, you should absolutely use prepared statements, and an api like pdo or mysqli instead:",0
5029,you need to ensure that array member is set first.,0
5030,try using the result of isset($_post['s']) to ensure it is set before trying to access it.,0
5031,"if you are merging lots of items and you expect to have a substantial number of duplicates then it may be worth it to explore more efficient alternatives, but don't worry about it preemptively.",0
5032,you can always work with the rows from a result set as an array and use foreach to loop through them.,0
5033,you didn't include your php code so we don't know whether this is via pdo or mysqli .. so this may be a bit off the mark.. but ..,0
5034,"to accomplish what you're trying to do, simply output the setcookie call when you've submitted your form in php :",0
5035,"this code actually does not work, as mentioned there are very basic syntax error that even prevents it from actually being run at all.",0
5036,"i'll assume this is a simplification error, however even the concatenation is wrong: the statement is duplicated each time (.= and the string itself.",0
5038,"the problem of having a dynamic number of parameters is interesting, and depending on the needs can be fairly convoluted, however in this case, a fairly simple param concatenation will allow you to achieve a dynamic number of parameters, as suggested by abracadaver .",0

5040,"the db connection should be injected through the constructor, not recreated every time you execute a query (as it will, if you connect in the index method).",0
5041,notice that $pdo is a private property.,0

5044,"one of these methods should be private, called by the other (public one) that would receive in arguments everything that is needed to run the functions.",0
5046,"we can adapt index so that it accepts both the sql and the values for the query, but these three lines could easily be transferred to the other method.",0
5048,"however, sanitizing your inputs is always a correct idea.",0
5049,"sanitize it outside of the function, then pass it as an argument to the ""search"" function, decoupling the function from the superglobal $_get .",0
5050,"defining the arguments for filtering is out of the rather large scope of this post, consult the documentation .",0
5051,"return by it self wont be enough sometimes.for example, if you want to recieve the json on an ajax call it has to be echoed.",0
5054,"since the queries you are executing are identical, you can just do this:",0
5055,you can't plug a value like that.,0

5058,if you want to get 3 and 328 as seperate values you need to use explode .,0
5059,you can than use foreach to print your exploded values.,0

5067,"certain characters have special significance in html, and should be represented by html entities if they are to preserve their meanings.",0
5068,this function returns a string with some of these conversions made; the translations made are those most useful for everyday web programming.,0
5069,"if you require all html character entities to be translated, use htmlentities() instead.",0
5070,"if the input string passed to this function and the final document share the same character set, this function is sufficient to prepare input for inclusion in most contexts of an html document.",0
5071,"if, however, the input can represent characters that are not coded in the final document character set and you wish to retain those characters (as numeric or named entities), both this function and htmlentities() (which only encodes substrings that have named entity equivalents) may be insufficient.",0
5072,you may have to use mb_encode_numericentity() instead.,0
5073,"in php, as in many languages, the order of things matters.",0
5074,"so, when your script is executing, and it reaches a function call, that function must already be defined somewhere.",0
5075,you can't just place a function anywhere (like inside an if block) and expect the code to search it out and use it.,0
5077,"while you're learning, just keep all your functions together at the top of the script, outside any logic blocks.",0

5086,select the db when opening the connection),0
5087,"also, you should use binding, either the one provided in mysqli, or even easier is pdo.",0
5088,during explode: maybe there is a chance that the string is not containt exact match whatever you given as reference in explode and due to that the notice occur.,0
5089,the error message is quite clear.,0
5090,when you see an error message like this the first thing you need to do is go to the manual .,0
5092,a blog post on how i managed to work around this using the excellent php utf8 lib .,0
5094,it might be cumbersome in this instance so try to get the above going.,0
5095,you need to make sure you start your session with,0
5096,"i may be wrong, but have you checked your ""password"" column in your database , i am getting the impresion that it has set a ""charlimit"" that truncates your passwords when you save them.",0
5097,so when you retrieve it it shorter than your hash.,0
5099,"you can check by type first, then use a htmlspecialchars and then cast to the type... although that would defy the use of htmlspecial chars.",0
5100,"also, i think the $a will probably come from some request variable, which will always be a string in that case.",0
5101,it almost sounds as if you would like a function to determine the context for you.,0
5104,"i just get the type, and do something like i show in the code below, even you can settype again later.",0
5105,assuming everything works ($acars and $ncars) have values and you want to know which were selected.,0
5106,you need to convert the array to a sting so it can be printed.,0
5107,have a look at the implode function.,0
5109,when you confirm the user login use session_start(); and set a variable such as `$loggedin=true;,0
5110,"on each page, check the $loggedin to see if it is there and set to true.",0
5112,"one way is to use array_merge() , you can make a function like this:",0
5113,"and if you call the function without passing parameters it is ok, its not mandatory and will return an array with all those 6 attributes all null.",0
5114,you could set a session variable on your login page (or any page that checks the login) that stores whether or not they're logged in and it will persist across pages.,0
5115,then you can simple wrap your admin html in an if statement like so:,0
5117,"as mentioned, if you use explode you will get an array with more than one element which is what your current method does.",0
5118,"however, i'm not sure why you would want to encapsulate the array values in quotes as you do?",0
5119,unless there is a specific need to encapsulate the array values within quotes then a minor alteration to the above could be:,0
5120,"first, you are mixing the mysql api's at somepoint you are using mysqli_* at some point u using mysql_* they don't mix.",0
5124,"another error : &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name""&gt; these two inputs fields have the same name attribute php will only read one.",0
5125,and you will get an undefined index here $misure = $_post['misure']; you need to activate error reporting while you are still developing so you can see your errors and notices:,0
5126,"add this at the top of every php page : ini_set('display_errors', 1); error_reporting(e_all);",0
5127,because you do not have post value with the submit attribute name.,0
5128,your submit does not have a name attribute.,0
5129,this is what u need to do to solve that :,0
5130,the thing is that array_shift() (link to documentation) returns the removed value so you can store that in the array and use it for the key.,0
5131,and the array after shifting is ready to be used.,0
5132,"if you think about it in a logical way, what does php need in order to execute the function?",0
5133,"so, strip_tags needs the $record['value'] to be inputted before it can execute the function and strip the tags from it.",0
5134,that function will return a value.,0
5135,"addslashes takes one argument, in your case it is strip_tags($record['value']) .",0
5136,addslashes can't be called when it's argument isn't resolved.,0
5137,it always puts them in sequentially.,0
5139,you will either need to pre-process the string or prune empty elements from the array.,0
5140,"note: you should probably use pdo instead for this, since the functions you are using have been deprecated if i have understood correctly.",0
5141,"apparently my answer below didn't work as you expected and even got a down vote, but it should work.",0
5144,loop over the array and check the key for the special cases you want to handle differently.,0
5145,"either way, you need to learn how to read documentation and more importantly how to use for example the function var_dump to see exactly what you're dealing with.",0
5146,for example try to run the following:,0
5147,does it give you what you thought you had?,0
5148,is it in fact an array?,0
5150,next you can try to run this:,0
5151,is name and value what they should be?,0
5154,"4th line of the html is a link that will give get variables of $_get['artikelnummer'] = artikelnummer and $_get['action'] = del if you click the link final line of the html is a hidden input that will give a get variable (since no method specified in the form element) of $_post['action'] = upd , there is a hidden input for the artikelnummer, and a text input for the number.",0
5155,you get this if you submit the form (there is no submit button in your current html),0
5156,"if multiple items, there is no way to tell which name=aantalartikel text input refers to which artikelnummer",0
5157,"a separate form for each product that you want to update so multiple submit buttons or, each name=aantalartikel text input must have a unique name e.g.",0
5160,you can try adding this to the top:,0
5161,"that piece of code will go to home, you can just to to your $page directly:",0
5162,"you need to change the ""name"" attribute of your ""input"" elements to indicate that it's an array by adding square brackets [] at the end.",0
5164,"you need to call session_start() on the iframe code too, are you actually calling it ?",0
5166,you don't need to check session_id() .,0
5167,the problem is with your last conditional statement being else instead of another else if .,0
5168,"having error reporting set to catch and display, would have thrown you something like this:",0
5170,the session array works like any other php arrray.,0
5171,"so if you want all your multiple arrays to be kept under $_session[""savearr""] then just add a [] like this",0
5173,"when sending that form, the actual values get overridden many times and you just see the last one.",0
5175,have a look at pdo or mysqli as a replacement!,0
5176,"your undefined index error is because you are using $_request['sessionsdrop']=='' , but your form code is -",0
5177,"so you should use $_request['session']=='' , instead of $_request['sessionsdrop']=='' since the super globals ( $_post , $_get , $_request ) reference the name , not the id .",0
5178,you can just use str_replace once you've used array_keys and array_values to get each side of the array:,0
5180,you should use validation to implement data security.,0
5181,"also, just use isset() instead of array_key_exists (it's more efficient, and less wordy):",0
5182,just add unset($set); at end of your loop.,0
5185,"something to watch out for if you want the ""set"" class applied even if the value of $short_list[$result['code']] is null.",0
5188,"try using mysql_num_rows instead mysqli, and try to output the value of mysql_num_rows() to see if it's 1.",0
5190,and you can remove the database connection calls above session_start() -- they aren't needed since you are doing a perfectly good call to mysqli_connect() after checking to see if the user is already logged in.,0
5191,i'm not seeing any session_start() you need it (see the manual ) in the beginning of any php file that uses sessions...,0
5192,step 1: try to understand what your error is trying to tell you.,0
5193,there is a variable issue on line 10.,0
5194,this would concatenate the value of $id++ into the href under each item.,0
5195,"then all you need to do is create a landing page for product_page.php , define the $id on that page again and pull the data for that product from the db.",0
5197,"you would define $id on your product_page.php using $_get['id'] , as it is in the url, supplied by your href above ^",0
5198,a good practice to get into whilst in the development stages would be to echo $id; to see if it is echoing the correct data from your while loop.,0
5199,if it echo's the correct $id then you can send the $id to the url through the href.,0
5200,"you have to return the statement , not rows.",0
5201,"it will make our function extremely handy and way more useful yet it will be kept as simple as this ""illustration code"".",0
5202,and it will solve your problem as just a side effect.,0
5203,want to get all the rows at once?,0
5204,just call your function this way,0
5205,"as you can see, in such a case fetch method can be simply ""linked"" to the runquery() method call, thanks to the very neat oop syntax feature called ""method chaining"".",0
5206,"all you need is to return the statement, not result.",0
5207,"not much writing, but enormous flexibility.",0
5208,now you can get any result type you want.,0
5209,"in fact, you're limiting yourself to just one result set type, making it complicated to get another type.",0
5210,but pdo already has billions of result set types - you need only to use them.,0
5214,what if you want to get the number of affected rows?,0
5216,"as a bonus, you don't even need to rewrite your existing code that was using inner fetchall() call.",0
5218,"you don't have to use double quotations "" for column name!",0
5219,"if $_post['selected-items'] is an array you should implode it's items with ,",0
5220,after using implode the $string will be like code below and you can use it for sql:,0
5221,"i assume that the $user_data['username'] is set or available,if yes then you could pass a variable name of you choice which points the message id instead of sending only the id (eg: i am setting it as msg_id ), now you can access the message id via $_get['msg_id']",0
5223,the data provider provides an array of which each entry is an individual test case.,0
5224,each test case is an array containing the arguments.,0
5225,since you said that you test is being run twice each data provider must be providing only one entry.,0
5226,array_merge appends the second data provider array to your first array making two test cases.,0
5227,if you want to combine the data provided by each data provider you will need to do something like the following:,0
5228,this takes the arguments from the second set of data and appends it to the arguments in the first.,0
5229,now your test will receive the combined arguments from both data providers.,0
5230,this assumes that both data arrays are the same length.,0
5231,"if they may not be, you will need to add some logic for handling that case.",0
5232,"also keep in mind for the list of arguments, phpunit does not reference the keys for matching the arguments to the variable.",0
5233,it is only based on the order of the values in the array.,0
5234,so be careful with the arguments in your test case with this.,0
5235,the loop for($i=0; $i &lt; sizeof($player_id); $i++) is an excessive loop.,0
5236,you are not using $i from this loop so you need not it.,0
5237,"just imagine, if your $player_id array has 3 items, you will loop it, and on every step of this looping, you also will loop whole $player_id array one more time by using foreach loop.",0
5240,"it's just one string $player_ids = array_map('intval', $_request['players']); , or $id = (int)$_post['id'] , or $number = (int)$_get['number'] , etc.",0
5241,another thing is overquering your database.,0
5242,"instead of creating separate query for every id, you can use one query with in operator, which right side is all ids joined by commas.",0
5243,"also, if you want to know why you need the use of ""!=="" or ""==="" read this: how do the php equality (== double equals) and identity (=== triple equals) comparison operators differ?",0
5244,the good solution would probably be to alter your set up so your json returns an array of dates rather than a string .,0
5246,that way you have an array you can loop through.,0
5247,you could use array_diff to compute the difference between the $a array against $array .,0
5248,this would give you all the values not in $array or $a .,0
5249,or you can use array_intersect to find those that are in those arrays.,0
5250,if you are using codeigniter and the value of $var is coming from a get request then you dont need to type such a long expression.,0
5251,"if you want play with true of false value in your url queries do it with ""1"" for true and ""0"" for false",0
5253,you only need to configure the server accordingly that it returns the expected value.,0
5254,you're apparently using newer than apache httpd 1.3.,0
5255,you need to set usecanonicalname directive to on in the &lt;virtualhost&gt; entry in httpd.conf (also check the warning at the bottom of the linked document!,0
5256,"mysqli_ functions are deprecated, don't use them anymore.",0
5258,this allows you to store information for the life of the user's session.,0
5259,"when the session is destroyed (user navigates away, closes browser, etc.",0
5260,"), the information is no longer there.",0
5261,"alternatively, you can use cookies to store this information long-term.",0
5262,"these methods are also more secure than storing the information on the page, as users can modify the dom elements on the page using a dom inspector, which most browsers now have.",0
5263,"the most secure method is using sessions, as cookie information can also be changed, but is relatively safe if you validate the information there first.",0
5264,database has no idea what data is stored in it.,0
5266,"but for what purposes - html/javascript/executable code/script code/or/whatever - db has no idea, so you'll need to take care about that in your application (or another layer which takes output responsibility).",0
5267,different data needs different ways to maintain safe output.,0
5268,"for html, it's htmlspecialchars() / htmlentities() - but for other data types it will be other things.",0
5270,main idea would be - store your data as it is - in database and provide safe output when it's needed (i.e.,0
5271,"split database, data logic and output and provide correct functioning for each of that part.",0
5272,you just need some adjustments about encoding.,0
5273,"in order to make sure the filename is encoded correctly when the browser sends it (so that the server receives it correctly, you must define a correct encoding but on the page that includes the upload form.",0
5274,"indeed, once a browser sends a request, it cannot change it, even if the response (as other responses suggest it), defines an encoding.",0
5276,"on the file that receives the post (here send.php ), everything should be received correctly.",0
5277,you can check whether the sent name is correct using var_dump($_files) .,0
5278,"if that's not the case, then your form probably doesn't include a proper encoding declaration (which means you didn't include the &lt;meta&gt; tag, or an header is maybe overwriting the &lt;meta&gt; tag.",0
5279,"in that case, include &lt;?php header('content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); ?&gt; at the beginning of the file handling the upload form.",0
5280,"somebody else was thinking to use pdo::attr_connection_status , but he figured out that: "" $db-&gt;getattribute(pdo::attr_connection_status) keeps replying “localhost via unix socket” even after stopping mysqld"".",0
5281,i also notice in your code that you're nesting a lot of values.,0
5282,it may be better if you do this within your php.ini file.,0
5283,"if you do, make sure you restart.",0
5285,"so if the condition of the second elseif holds, so does the condition of the first elseif .",0
5286,the body of the second elseif is therefore never executed (the body of the first elseif is executed instead).,0
5288,will fail with an undefined error on the unset() line if the cart is initially undefined.,0
5289,see the answer to your first question for elaboration of that.,0
5291,"if you implemented the solution to the 'clear' question, this will always return true since you initialise the cart to an empty array.",0
5292,(btw - please update the code above to reflect the 'clear' solution from that question),0
5293,"as for the rest of the update code, i could suggest several improvements, but unless you can implement a method of populating your cart, then it's all a bit academic.",0
5294,"if, on the other hand, this is omly one from a set of scripts, and if it expects the cart to have been populated by another one before it does anything, then you will need to explicity add a test to make sure $max is not zero and do nothing if it is.",0
5296,this is not how it works in zf.,0
5298,or use a hidden field named formname and check in your code what's its value is.,0
5299,you can also use a different action for each form and in the end redirect to the signupaction wich would yeld the same result without the hassle.,0
5301,alternatively using prepared statements such as create table ?,0
5302,and then just execute the query.,0
5303,"you always want to escape ` identifiers, even table names and field names, as maybe tomorrow they will be reserved words and break your query.",0
5304,"as long as you are using prepared statements (pdo, mysqli, or whatever) you will be fine.",0
5306,"you just need to fine grain your filtering mechanism, as to what table name, etc is allowed and not.",0
5307,"btw: don't do it like you are tring to do: ""create table {$quoted_table_name} like {$table_name}"";.. user prepared statements with placeholders (?, or :name, etc.)",0
5308,"edit: since you need to secure identifiers, i see 2 ways:",0
5309,surround them with (`) filtering &amp; escaping incoming values (mysql_real_escape_string or better).,0
5310,filtering will include striping away any unnecessary characters (you might want to allow only letters [a-z]+ or letters with digits.,0
5311,what you are asserting is if variable $testvar is set (not if it's empty or not).,0
5312,"the variable themselves don't have a return type, but it's in the context they are used in a control flow operator such as an if statement.",0
5314,"when you want to check for empty string, you have several options:",0
5317,without knowing further what is not functioning it's hard to suggested anything further.,0
5319,if you are passing a user with a session on one server to a page on another (where you would like to persist the session) you will need to develop a method of handing that off.,0
5320,preferably with a token and encrypted serialized $_session which can then be authenticated and loaded.,0
5321,you are displaying the data from the database before you update it.,0
5323,"in your code (even if a user has submitted an update), you query the data, pull it from database and display it, then run the update with what the user submitted.",0
5330,"edit 2: the page is being updated after the user submits the form, but the page you display to the user is querying the database before you update it - and using that to display the page to the user.",0
5331,string offsets provide a mechanism to use strings as if they were an array of characters:,0
5332,"as for the isset($model['service'][0]) return value, i'm a bit surprised.",0
5333,this is a simplified test case:,0
5334,use array_key_exists() or empty() instead of isset() .,0
5335,php caches old array values strangely.,0
5336,they have to be manually unset using unset(),0
5337,"here's a cleaned-up version with more descriptive variable names, and less code duplication, that you can examine if you need some inspiration.",0
5339,which means that unsetting the php variable will have no impact on the transactions/data on the db side.,0
5340,"the array on the right has the keys 0 , 1 , 2 etc.",0
5341,"the $_post array has the keys name , email etc (i assume).",0
5342,"array_intersect_key intersects on the keys of both arrays, not on the keys of one and the values of the other.",0
5343,but in this case your output will be ended with - .,0
5344,"so, one of the solutions is to collect values in array and implode 'em:",0
5346,it returns boolean false if there is no match so you should be looking for that.,0
5347,just pass $_session['gv_1'] as a parameter to sg_gc1() .,0
5348,then it will automatically be local in that function using the name of the parameter as you define it in sg_gc1() .,0
5349,in this case it will be $gv_1 .,0
5350,doing this way doesn't hard code your session variable into your function so if in the future that value isn't in a session but another variable you do not need to refactor your code.,0
5351,it also makes your code easier to understand and maintain.,0
5352,you can use preg_match method to catch the stuff between http and .com,0
5353,i think the simplest way to accomplish this but not error free is:,0
5355,"however, it is deprecated since php 5.5.0 and the reference suggests using mysqli_fetch_field (which forces you to make a select from the response as zerkms suggest in the comment) or pdostatement::fetchcolumn if you are willing to use pdo.",0
5356,if you want to check for blank also then please use empty this will return you the true in following cases.,0
5357,"if you access the post data in php using $_post , it mean you need to use x-www-form-urlencoded in request header.",0
5358,"it seems like what you are looking for is array_key_exists(0, $match[0])",0
5361,you should better change the way you send your params if it's possible.,0
5364,"generally, it is recommended to do isset or empty checks first, though.",0
5365,this will prevent warnings from being generated.,0
5366,you no longer need the isset (or empty ) in your if since you already checked that.,0
5368,i'd say you think it is false because the string's position might be 0 which evaluates to false (assuming you are using a needle that is present in the string).,0
5369,you should always compare with === .,0
5370,"explanation: there is an escape sign before double quote ("") but it doesn't perform it's function.",0
5372,that function will convert it to character codes that will prevent it from rendering as actual html.,0
5373,what you want is to print the actual html.,0
5377,one thing i noticed is on $_session['username']==$dbusername; shouldn't it be only 1 equals?,0
5378,as your assigning $dbusername to the $_session['username'] variable.,0
5379,"first, you should not be including the table names.",0
5382,"third, you have no error handling to tell you whether your query is successful or not.",0
5383,"in fact, you have the opposite of error handling, because you are trying to use the @ operator to suppress your errors.",0
5384,"instead, you should do something like this:",0
5387,the left join is the key here.,0
5390,"here's a demo on what i mean on those missing name="""" .",0
5391,i've explicitly omit field 3 so that you can see.,0
5393,"you can't separate 2 statements with , ,it should be separated with || or &amp;&amp; .",0
5394,the logical operators article will get you familiar with these operators.,0
5395,"also, $_request is very insecure.its best not to use them.the reason for not using them is explained here .",0
5396,"you don't have variable $user defined anywhere, it should be $username",0

5402,"in order to preserve all these, try wrapping your print_r output in &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; .",0
5403,"just a quick guess by looking at your code, you are not escaping the value of $picture when you place it in the database, which could be why the image value in the database is not updating.",0
5404,"also, i really recommend that you use the mysqli extension: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php",0

5408,"will only evaluate to true if a blank string was explicitly passed in - otherwise the value of $_get['foo'] might be equivalent to a blank string, but the type would not be since it would actually be an empty value for that index, not a string.",0
5409,there's obviously quite a lot of repetition going on here.,0
5410,"most of it could be removed by refactoring the code, but as a starting point even with the current process, you could make it perform better by using a better database api.",0
5414,"yes, these could definitely be simplified.",0
5415,the three queries in the loop could be combined into a single query using group by .,0
5416,the query would look something like this:,0
5417,you should get the same three values from this query as three records to fetch.,0
5424,you should be using mysqli or pdo .,0
5435,"are you sure, you have $ in $_cookie keys?",0
5437,"the converts the ""\r\n"" into a string to make it safe to input into the database.",0
5443,"inserting into json, inserting into mysql, inserting into other databases).",0
5444,use the right one for what you need - and don't use it for other purposes.,0
5445,as it currently stands your code is not safe even with all those efforts - but it's really simple to fix!,0
5446,change your code and use question marks as your place holders for your prepared variables.,0
5447,"and you have a syntax error in your prepared statement, you cannot use prepared statement and use your pdo to execute the prepared statement $db-&gt;exec should be $requete-&gt;execute",0
5448,the specific answer to this really depends on what type of database you are using and whether you want to do this validation in php or in the database.,0
5449,"i would lean towards using triggers on the database to check for overlapping times on any insert, this way, if you end up having more than one interface to insert or update these record (e.g.",0
5451,your php could then catch the exception thrown on these particular inserts/updates (you are using pdo?),0
5452,when the trigger throws an exception.,0
5453,if you can add more information about what database you are using and also some more info about your table structures (all fields on both affected tables and their data types etc.),0
5454,then you can get more specific answers on how the trigger needs to look.,0
5455,i raised a similar question to this requirement a little while ago to which i received an excellent answer ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/8182800/1053722 ).,0
5456,this applies if you are using postgresql.,0
5457,it doesn't work the way you wrote it in the question.,0
5458,the function _create_days() is called and it returns a value that replaces the function call.,0
5459,"even if the function returns multiple values in an array, the array as a whole is placed in the outer array you want to build.",0
5460,the solution is to write the function _create_days() to return an array of values and merge this returned array into the outer array using array_merge() for example:,0
5461,another option is to use a placeholder when you build $header and replace it later with the values returned by _create_days() using the function array_splice() :,0
5465,you can make it a function and replace latest_receipt with a variable to extract your other data.,0
5466,"you need to make a db connection and execute your query, like",0
5468,"failing to quote it as a string value, mysql assumes that the supplied unquoted $table is a column identifier.",0
5469,if $imgid is also a non-numeric value you'll need to quote that one as well.,0
5470,"we assume it has already been properly filtered against sql injection, if it is the result of user input.",0
5471,"i'll note, since the update includes mysqli-specific code, that you really ought to be doing this as a prepared statement rather than a constructed string call to mysqli::query() .",0
5474,your data is already utf-8 which is evidenced by htmlentities working out &amp;theta; when utf-8 is specified.,0
5475,"since your data is already in utf-8, utf8_encode will make it even worse.",0
5476,"this is just supplemental information, your raw data is correct in the first place so nothing need to be done.",0
5481,"if you send the location header, the browser won't load the response (your script) anymore from the current page but directly change to to the new location.what you could do is to add something like &amp;message=failedlogin to the path before sending the location header and then display a message in the previous page.",0
5482,you could also store it in the session: $_session['loginsuccess']=false; and then check for this value in the previous php page.,0
5483,"you are getting the error message ""could not upload for some reason!""",0
5484,"because, you have told your mysql query to show you that, incase the query fails, instead of the asking it for the real error, by doing or die(mysql_error()) here",0
5485,"so, you need to change the above code to adding or die(mysql_error())",0
5488,the web browser ignores plain newline characters so you need to convert them to &lt;br /&gt; elements to make them show up.,0
5490,what we did to solve this problem is to replace acl.provider service with our own and in that service add a method to make a direct query to the database:,0
5492,"drawbacks: this methods have to be improved to take into account the complexities of acl inheritance and strategies, but for simple use cases it works fine.",0
5494,you can remove all of this because it is redundant.,0
5499,"first, no space after $_post , but even then the single = will cause the value of $_post['police'] to be assigned a value of 1 and always return true.",0
5500,using the double = will just check if the value of $_post['police'] is equal to 1.,0
5502,so just use post instead of get in &lt;form method&gt;,0
5504,"for example, if, in that post, i could include a script tag, that could be very dangerous for any user reading my post.",0
5505,"to prevent this, you want to use htmlentities :",0
5506,"now, if you want to save my post in your database, you must beware of sql injections.",0
5508,"so, you must basically prevent your user from including quotes and double quotes in his post, or, more precisely, you should escape them.",0
5511,"basically, that's all you need in almost all the cases.",0
5513,"there would be this alternate boolean evaluation approach, but it just goes to show that you have to duplicate something :",0
5514,"str_replace() is able to accept an array as the first two arguments, for example (from the docs):",0
5516,so the user can watch the cookie values.,0
5517,it would be the best you encrypt the cookie data so the user can't see the values in plain text.,0
5518,what you can do with cookies aswell you can read here: php-manual for set_cookie,0
5520,"as you picked up on, you may need to use strtolower() so that the strings will match.",0
5521,please note: you can also add required at the end of each input field.,0
5522,"you are trying to get data in $_get array, but your form method is post, so you have to do this:",0
5523,"the query string values are in the $_get collection where the key is the key being passed (""category"") and the value is the value being passed (""novelty""), so you'd reference the value as:",0
5524,"the nested conditionals might get a little unwieldy, but you can organize and arrange the logic however you wish at this point.",0
5525,"meaning mod_courts followed by a number (and only that, thanks to ^$ matching the beginning and end of the string).",0
5526,no need for the strpos check.,0
5527,"you have two choices here, you can either wrap the entire php block in a isset($_post['submit']) conditional (can be substituted with @jeroen's conditional) or you can submit your form to a separate script for processing.",0
5529,rather they are marked for collection by the garbage collector.,0
5532,"there is no $_server[""document_root""] present when you call the script from the command line.",0
5533,"that variable (along with many others like request_uri , script_name , http_host ....) is set by apache, which is not running in your case.",0
5534,"to find out whether you are running in the context of a web site or from the command line, use php_sapi_name() .",0
5535,whar do you wxpect with this: print_r($id); ?,0
5537,if you need a json response then:,0
5538,what you do in your code is very dangerous.,0
5539,you have an sql-injection in your query.,0
5540,when you use mysqli then use prepared statements.,0
5541,its not the best way to store images in a blob field.,0
5542,there could be a lot of problems.,0
5543,check your database encoding that everything is utf-8.,0
5544,then check your logs if you get some errors.,0
5545,its possible that you have an error before the header command.,0
5547,"last possibility &lt;img src=""objectimage.php that you have more directory entries and your browser can't find the php file.",0
5548,by default you should get a comma-separated list of elements in target_employer_id .,0
5549,you can use the php explode function to turn that into an array in your php logic.,0
5550,it may be just an oversight but the function in your code is incorrect: it is should not be start_session() but session_start() .,0
5551,finally you can check apache error log to see if you can find any meaningful error messages.,0
5552,by default on linux it will be in /var/log/apache2/error.log or /var/log/httpd/error.log,0
5553,do you want to keep the sub-arrays that have the most items?,0
5554,your descriptions appear to say this.,0
5555,"aside: if you need the filtered array to have zero-based keys, call array_values() on it.",0
5556,"if everything else is ok, then i am afraid you have a simple typo in your code that is causing you the problem.",0
5557,you have missed the equal to sign in your code after name.,0
5558,"on a side note, you should not use $_request['name'] but instead use $_post['name'] when the form method is post.",0
5562,you did it wrong with mysqli and you shouldn't repeat it with pdo.,0
5563,use a dom parser to get the information you need (the date div contents); explode on the space character; (int) the first number and rtrim the month to get rid of the comma.,0
5564,you can use strip_tags in php to get the date and then use strtotime to normalize the date.,0
5565,"after setting session $_session['user'] , the content of the if (isset($_session['user'])) will be sent to ajax too.",0
5569,so in your case you're just seeing the very first hello twice due to this.,0
5571,you should be able to configure the timeout using pdo.,0
5573,firstly like napster3world said you really need to start your session or nothing of much use will come of your error reporting.,0
5576,both are wrong if you want to get the values from $_post .,0
5577,you need to send key-value pairs to the server and then you can access them in $_post by these keys.,0
5579,you do not close your if (isset($_post ['username'])) { condition with },0
5581,"so if you don't upload any file, $_files[""file""][""name""] will be an empty string, and file_exists() function will check whether this directory ../employee/ exists or not, which does exist in your case.",0
5582,and this is the reason why your file validation is failing.,0
5584,and this is why you shouldn't use mysql_* functions .,0
5585,though you have to remove a space from team name key in order to use named placeholders,0
5586,"also, c# arrays are indexed starting at 0. you can change the starting index of arrays in php, but you can't in c#.",0
5587,"perhaps you do wish to take the 2nd and 3rd items, but keep it in mind.",0
5588,here's how i would do it.,0
5589,"there's no reason to use ""complicated"" preg_match trickery when you can use explode() .",0
5590,fourth: i wouldn't recommend using mysqli anymore.,0
5592,"as i understand it, your function tries to find out, what fields were in the select clause of the query to build the result array.",0
5593,that is only necessary if you want to allow your database layer it to execute arbitrary queries which is also not a good idea.,0
5594,"when i have to use classic sql in an application, i predefine every query that i need in some method or function.",0
5595,that function then will know exactly what field it has to read from the result set.,0
5596,so there's no need to parse the sql code.,0
5597,"however, mostly i try to avoid sql by using things like doctrine orm .",0
5598,sql is just too prone to errors...,0
5600,"it makes code unreadable to humans and unparsable to an ide it's nearly impossible to debug code that uses eval() not really a problem of eval() itself, but when you have to use it, that's a sign of a flawed design.",0
5601,"one other approach to your problem would be to build the sql statement inside your query class (arguments would be field names, the table, the where constraints,... ) and to develop subclasses for different query types.",0
5602,this would elimiate the need to parse the statement.above this layer you would put a bunch of dao classes to do the actual work.,0
5603,but wait: others have done this... (maybe a lot of others to be specific).,0
5604,"so using pdo, doctrine, propel or even a bigger library like zendframework (active record pattern there...) would be the most valuable and stable option.",0
5605,"if you, however, want to learn something about software architecture and oo systems.",0
5606,"go ahead and build your own, if you do it well you can switch to another db layer as soon as your system grows (version 2.x :-) ).",0
5607,"using empty() instead of isset() takes care of your third scenario, where the parameter is present but not defined.",0
5609,"the way you have it, the if-statement will always run, no matter what $hop equaled.",0
5611,"to get the equivalent of a short-circuit || from javascript in php, you can use ?",0
5612,": (the so-called ""elvis operator"" - x ?",0
5613,: y is a shorthand for x ?,0
5614,"however i think there is a logic error in your code anyway, because if you have e_notice error reporting on, php will complain anyway if $days['value'] is set and $dy['value'] isn't, because you are still accessing $dy['value'] even if isset($dy['value']) == false .",0
5615,"so you would need to use, for example:",0
5617,if you don't care about notice errors at all (discouraged!),0
5618,"i believe that because you are using mysqli_connect that you need to use the mysqli_query($conn,$sql) notation.",0
5619,"if you want an array of arrays, you can use",0
5621,"since you're checking strlen of a boolean, it will never match and always go to the explode .",0
5622,there are a couple issues with using array_merge or the + operator with arrays assuming there is a defined offset but the value happens to be null.,0
5624,selects first valid input (eg first valid number or e-mail).,0
5625,does not trigger undefined index notice.,0
5626,no need to use @ .,0
5627,if you submit the form and print_r($_post) you will get the follow array:,0
5628,"as you see, there is no [field1] or [field2] in the response!",0
5629,"for instance, if you are interested in the select tag and the textarea tag, you should whether update you html code or you php code.",0
5631,you can't use mysqli and mysql at a same time.. mysqli is a class... so first change that things...,0
5633,you can add a print_r($arr); inside your function after you do the array_shift to see the shortened version of the array within the function scope.,0
5634,it just won't affect the original array unless you pass it by reference.,0
5635,"as it stands, your $es array is an indexed one, but you're trying to search in its keys - which are simple numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...).",0
5636,"first, try to do this: var_dump(""&lt;pre&gt;"", $lang); die(); and see what are you actually getting in $lang .",0
5638,"so [0] is used to get the first item in that array, which is the element we want to delete.",0
5639,the simplexmlelement returned from $node[0] represents a collection of &lt;event&gt; elements (but if you access elements/attributes on it then the values from the first in the collection is used).,0
5640,"so, we use [0] to get at the actual simplexmlelement that we want to delete, which is the first in this magical collection.",0
5642,forking a process for each client is super heavy.,0
5643,afaik an average pc can tolerate around 2000 threads and it's not going to work fast.,0
5644,"switching between processes means that cpu should save its state in memory, and if you have enormous amount of processes, cpu will be busy with memory io and will have little time for actually doing stuff.",0
5645,you may want to look at apache for inspiration.,0
5646,"in apache they use a fixed amount of worker processes/threads, each process/thread working with multiple clients via select function and sockets in a non-blocking mode.",0
5647,this is a far more robust approach.,0
5648,"regarding database io, i would spawn a process/thread that would be the sole owner of database connections.",0
5649,worker processes would communicate with the db io process using ipc (in case of processes) or lock-free queues (in case of threads).,0
5650,this approach makes you independent of pdo implementation details (if it is thread safe or does it spawn connections etc).,0
5652,there is a minor error in the sql statement for deleting the record - there are spurious periods .,0
5655,i'm not sure that a mysqli result will survive a mysqli->close() so i've retrieved the data from the $result into an array and returned that.,0
5657,"however, you can still use x-forwarded-for and cf-connecting-ip .",0
5659,"this is a simple guess, i haven't really used these librairies (except for smarty) in a while, but it might be that one of the libraries (facebook or gettext) also define a __autoload function that gets called instead of your own.",0
5660,"as a follow up regarding accessing put and delete data, currently there is no superglobal built in to php to access this data directly.",0
5661,"as the data is file data, which can be rather large, the usefulness and efficiency of reading the entire file contents in a typical assignment statement $variable = $_put['file']; is questionable.",0

5664,"hand wringing aside (you can leave comments, after all), there really isn't a compelling reason not to do it like this, but again, there isn't a compelling reason to do it, either.",0
5665,why not put the values in a $_session key if you want them global?,0
5667,"with all the other optional approaches, i think that overwriting $_post , while it won't make your server explode, is the most likely to cause you a headache down the road.",0

5697,"of course, it looks like you don't really need to manipulate the value of $output in your script, but in order to illustrate the usefulness of the option in print_r, i put in a line of code that replaces linux newlines (\n) with windows newlines (\r\n), so that programs like notepad can properly display the text (php's print_r function only places \n newlines in the output, even on windows machines, which is why i found this post.",0
5698,i was trying to find a way to correct that behavior).,0
5699,"that may not prove useful to you at this time, but it may, later, and may prove useful to others who come across this question.",0
5700,you should almost never use addslashes .,0
5701,"most times when it might be useful, there is a more specific general escaping function available (or, occasionally, one needs to be written).",0
5703,addslashes is unsafe for sql and you should never use it in that context.,0
5704,use parameterized queries instead as quentin suggests.,0
5705,consider adding session_regenerate_id() after the session_start.,0
5706,"this will prevent session cookie stealing (phpsessid in your cookies' id is regenerated on each pageload if you use the above function), which is probably what is happening (apart from the exit problem on the answer above)",0
5710,if you use pdo or mysqli you can use a prepared statement to help you with that:,0
5711,you need to use putenv() ( http://php.net/manual/en/function.putenv.php ) instead of trying to use any of the methods you have used ( $_env or $_server ).,0
5712,this doesn't seem to be possible in the way you're trying to do it.,0
5713,"when a file gets placed into the $_post variable, it's given a temporary name for a file that only lives a very short amount of time (probably only reliably until the end of the initial page request, and then php will clean it up).",0
5714,"this won't work for an &lt;img&gt; tag because when the browser loads on the next page, the browser is going to perform a separate request for that file after the initial page load, and it won't be there anymore.",0
5715,the correct way to do this is to use move_uploaded_file() to permanently save the file to disk using the tmp_name variable provided in $_post .,0
5716,this means you'll have to come up with a way of tracking it and potentially cleaning it up if the user decides not to use it.,0
5717,i wish your approach could work.,0
5718,it would be very convenient :),0
5720,it does not check whether the variable is containing an empty string!,0
5721,"using isset() on $_post['key'] will return true in this circumstance, because the variable itself has been set and passed through from the form.",0
5722,"because you're assigning the value of $_post['fname'] to the $fname variable, the value will always been assigned, even if it's empty.",0
5725,"the php script can only ""see"" the information which is posted (the value for the selected option that is posted).",0
5727,this will make the $_post['test_text'] available with the selected index (but you should also force the onchange() function when the page loads so that it will be populated even if the user leaves the select field at the default value.,0
5728,remember array_push — push one or more elements onto the end of array and not create an index.,0
5729,"you'll need to do some extra work to get the proper formatting, though",0
5730,i just figured out how you can do that by using the parse_str php built-in function.,0
5731,the parse_str should explode query arguments both on ; and &amp; .,0
5734,"i just run a test to compare the plain-php splitting vs parse_str() , on an array of 10000 query strings each made of 500 arguments.",0
5735,"the my_parse_str() above took ~0.952 seconds, while the pure-php one ( parsequerystring() ) took ~4.25 seconds.",0
5736,"it would require a larger set of data to test exactly how much it is faster, but it's pretty clear which one wins :) (if you want the test data + scripts, i'll upload them somewhere, since the data file is 125mb ).",0
5737,the reason why you also have to encode quotes is becuase you don't need &lt;> to exploit some xss.,0
5739,"you don't need &lt;> to execute javascript in this case because you can use onmouseover, here is an example attack:",0
5740,"e-mail is a bit different, javascript shouldn't be executed by the mail client, and if it is then your site isn't affected due to the same origin policy.",0
5742,"however, php's mail() function can succumb to a different type of vulnerability, its called crlf injection.",0
5743,here is an example vulnerability against php-nuke .,0
5744,"if you have a function call like this: mail($fmail, $subject, $message, $header); then you must make sure that a user cannot inject \r\n into $header.",0
5745,"well you can first create rules for certain fields, like email the only thing it should consist of is letters, numbers, @ (at-symbol?",0
5748,"i'll assume you have them in an array, $cats .",0
5749,with this you can then use implode() :,0
5750,the best approach is to explode the string and produce a query that looks like:,0
5751,"as juergen points out, you can use find_in_set() for this purpose.",0
5752,that solution cannot take advantages of an index on id .,0
5753,"but if you then want to use that id to retrieve from db or anything, you're gonna have to explode that apart...like so....to get each piece.",0
5754,"but i would avoid all that part, by just assigning the id to the value only...like so..",0
5755,"it's certainly unconventional to use the combination of id and name for the option values, but it should work.",0
5756,the problem is presents is that you now have a composite string which needs to be parsed in order to be useful.,0
5757,generally what one would do is just use the id as the value and the name as the display.,0
5758,all you should need to use it throughout the code is the id.,0
5759,you have to use asort since $array[0] is a plain array.,0
5760,the code creates variables from data in the $_post array.,0
5762,naming variables dynamically) variable variables .,0
5763,"this is usually a bad idea, because you do not control, which keys are present in the $_post array, and thus, which variables are created.",0
5764,the user of your website controls this.,0
5765,a malicious user might name the post variables in such a way that they overwrite variables that you intended for different purposes.,0
5766,the book suggests to allow keys in the $_post array to overwrite variables in a controlled manner .,0
5767,"that's what $expected = array('carmodel', 'year', 'bodystyle') is for.",0
5768,"this and the following code only creates the variables $carmodel , $year and $bodystyle .",0
5770,"$_post[input2] is wrong, but it should work.",0
5771,"that's because input2 is recognized as constant, not as string (what it should be).",0
5772,change that into $_post['input2'] (see also php manual ).,0
5774,pay attention to the legibility of your code to avoid this!,0
5776,you should do this with $key .,0
5777,i do know there is no reason to use it because you can use __dir__ (or dirname(__file__) on older versions of php).,0
5779,you can keep the unit value in session and compare with current value.,0
5780,"if changed, then reset the $counter .",0
5781,then update the session value with current value for the next cycle of test.,0
5782,"ok, here is a simple login that is not meant for real world usage.",0
5783,please read the comments included in the code to see what i have to say about each.,0
5785,"the security issues associated with a more sophisticated use are perhaps beyond this answer, but the below code is the way i would interpret what you have posted above, without getting to detailed (to the point of possibly making it hard to understand the simplest steps occurring).",0
5786,let me know if you have any questions.,0
5787,"to see the form in action, check:",0
5790,make note of where it went in the original string somehow.,0
5791,then use str_replace on the original string and do whatever parsing you like on the code box string.,0
5792,finally reinsert the parsed code boxes and display.,0
5793,"seems simple enough, it's complaining that the offset you're giving for the start of the search (8) is not contained within the string.",0
5794,you can see this in action if you head on over to an online php tester site and enter:,0
5795,"""enough sanitization"" thoroughly depends on what environment you're talking about.",0
5799,"that should be all you need, unless you have special requirements.",0
5801,"sanitization is a worthy goal, and if you can keep your contexts separate, you'll run into fewer problems with data manipulation between them.",0
5802,take a look at data property of settings object that you pass to your ajax here .,0
5803,"if you use it, you can make your js code much simpler:",0
5805,"otherwise your code is opened for sql injections.you can do, at least, like this:",0
5807,from the command line there is no $_server['document_root'] .,0
5808,that one is only available from the http-server (apache).,0
5809,try cd to the current path by using __dir__ in the start of your script,0
5810,most likely at one point you're passing an empty string to your function.,0
5811,offset in the strpos call indicates from which character it should start searching for $needle .,0
5813,"as mentioned before, the offset is 0-based, so if $needle you're searching for is exactly in the beginning of $haystack , it cannot be found if $offset is 1. with $offset = 1 it would be as if you're searching in a string that looks like this: 'otmail test test test test' .",0
5815,to answer your second question - you have two issues in your code.,0
5816,"second of all, with ""hotmail"" being at position 0, your strposab() function will return a value of int(0), which is a non-boolean value that when used in a boolean expression evaluates to false.",0
5817,"therefore, you need to use the !== operator in order to avoid type juggling.",0
5818,so the correct if statement to use will be:,0
5819,edit : the comments below are true.,0
5821,"however, here's a function if you need to accept these as valid values:",0
5824,"please have a look at: setcookie, cannot modify header information - headers already sent",0
5825,the last_insert_id() is generated at the end of each successful query from the same connection handle.,0
5826,therefore your example code will not give you the result you are looking for.,0
5827,"to receive the result you seek, using the same format you used in your example (which i don't recommend for risk of sql injection - use mysqli instead) you can do so like:",0
5828,you can set name[1] (or name[] ) as name of variable instead of name in this case in php you will get array $_post['name'],0
5829,"alternatively, if you're numbering them you can use a foreach on the $_post variable:",0
5830,"but yes, there is a better way of passing variables through jquery:",0
5832,array_push() could be used if the array was a numeric array (i.e.,0
5833,the keys were integers - e.g.,0
5834,"0 =&gt; 'cat', 1 =&gt; 'dog' .",0
5835,"but in this case, the array is an associative array .",0
5836,"one way to set the desired key, sandbox , is to set the array key by specifying it in bracket notation:",0
5837,this is necessary because the other keys of the array are not,0
5840,"in your form you need check, if variable is defined:",0
5846,"in php, isset() is a special form, not a function; when you call isset($ary[$index]) , $ary itself doesn't have to be set first.",0
5847,"even with e_strict , the call won't generate a warning, because isset doesn't actually try to access $ary[$index] ; it gets as far as determining that $ary is not set and returns false .",0
5848,so you don't need to check the array first in order to apply isset to an element.,0
5849,"your question indicates that you know this already, and are wondering if there's a reason why you would do it anyway.",0
5851,"in your code, $row is an array .",0
5852,"if that is not possible, you can replace the pdo functions for mysqli* functions.",0
5853,"rinse, lather, repeat for the rest of the class methods",0
5857,it might be inefficient to construct the array on every function call.,0
5859,"as always in these cases, i will add that you should avoid using mysql in favour of mysqli (improved).",0
5860,"if converting from one character set to another, i would use the php functions, rather than reinventing the wheel.",0
5861,instead of using preg_replace i think in this instance it's better to use str_replace .,0
5862,we will search a string for the keys of the queue array and replace them with their corresponding values.,0
5863,this is also a very readable and easy solution.,0
5864,the whole point of the singleton is to get the same object every time so unsetting $searcher doesn't work.,0
5865,you can use $searcher->removeattributetoselect($k) to remove each attribute filter.,0
5866,strpos will return 0 if the needle is at the very start of the haystack.,0
5867,"but 0 evaluates to boolean false , so your if condition fails.",0
5868,"you need to compare to false , which is the return value if the needle isn't found at all:",0
5869,the explode takes the delimited value off so you would need to re-append it.,0
5871,so better turn to pdo or sqli,0
5872,"mysql_fetch_object() is similar to mysql_fetch_array() , with one difference - an object is returned, instead of an array.",0
5873,"indirectly, that means that you can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are illegal property names).",0
5874,you can get the last inserted id using mysql_insert_id() before the insert query and then you can increment it and save it as image name.,0
5877,in your case you may use any one of following:,0
5878,$_session is array you can use its index like $_session['indexname'] detail,0
5879,therefore your code fails on line 20 (the if) as it tries to read the 'flavor' cookie.,0
5880,then it goes into the else and fails for all variables.,0
5881,add the isset and you should see the content of the if as long as no cookies are set,0
5882,you check to see whether $_post['name'] is set and whether the value of $_post['flavor'] and $_post['scoop'] is true .,0
5883,which in your case it is not.,0
5884,"and this is also why the echo test, that i asked you to do in the comment section is not working, since the condition of the if statement is not met.",0
5885,"instead all you need to do is perform three separate insert into queries, i.e.",0
5887,all you'll need to do is add extra input fields to your form to get the extra data you want.,0
5888,"if $comments contains \n\n\n then after replacement, it will be \n\n resulting in an empty element at explode.",0
5890,you need to ass the value yo your submit button:,0
5891,check post_max_size in your php settings and compare it with the data size you are posting.,0
5892,use fiddler to make an http request and check what it returns.,0
5893,"use print_r($_post); on the top of the save.php , to check what you are getting in it.",0
5894,use tool like firebug to check what jquery has posted.,0
5895,you should also verify the json object on client side that you are posting.,0
5896,"json.stringify(some_object); try posting some basic sample data { ""data1"":1, ""data2"":2, ""data3"":3, ""data4"":4, ""data5"":5 , ""data6"":6 }",0
5897,most probably you are sending to much data or likely data is invalid!,0
5898,you can verify the value of the content-length header being received by the php.,0
5900,"if it does not match, that's your error then and there.",0
5901,"and that's all the diagnostics you need - if the content-length does not match the post data, reject the post as invalid; no need of extra parameters (computing the post data length might be a hassle, though).",0
5904,"that is receiving an incomplete query (with content-length > actual length) and is incorrectly rewriting it, making it appear ""correct"" to the server, instead of rejecting it out of hand.",0
5905,"it occurred to me then that content length might well be off by one or two in case the request ended with carriage return, and what carriage return - lf?",0
5906,"however, when i added simple html to be able to post it from a browser",0
5907,"i was able to verify that in firefox (latest), ie8, chrome (latest), all running on xp pro sp3, the value of the content-length is the same as the strlen of php://input .",0
5908,the only problem is that php://input is not always available even for post data.,0
5910,"on the other hand if the problem is in jquery, i.e.",0
5911,"somehow the interruption prevents jquery from assembling the full post, and yet the post is made up, the content-length calculated of the incomplete data, and the packet sent off -- then my workaround can't possibly work, and the ""telltale"" extra field must be used, or... perhaps the .post function in jquery might be extended to include a crc field?",0
5912,so the only thing that can go wrong is that jquery only gathers part of the data and then makes a post request.,0
5913,"using just $.post('save.php', data) as you mentioned, that wont happen.",0
5914,its either working to gather the data or its waiting for a response from the server.,0
5916,"and if you switch after the request has been made and you move away quickly, before all data has been transmitted, the apache server will see it as half a request and wont invoke php.",0
5917,is it possible that you are using seperate pages for succesfull and partial requests?,0
5918,because php does only add the first 1000 elements to $_post and perhaps the failed requests have more then data1000=data elements?,0
5919,so there wont be an eof param.,0
5920,is it possible that you are gathering the data in a global var in javascript and have an onbeforeunload method that sends data as well?,0
5922,can you share some information on the data you are seding?,0
5923,are there a lot of small elements (like data1 till data10000) or a few large once?,0
5925,like always data6 as you mention?,0
5927,"you must adopt it to your table fields, but with this logic you will have an array where by the third column (in my example), you can know if it is connector, adapter or component found, then generate proper links or do other actions with this data.",0
5928,this is because you're using a pre- increment rather than a post-increment.,0
5929,"if $id_timeslot is 1 before entering the loop, the value of ++$id_timeslot is 2, so the first generated query is:",0
5932,"if id_timeslot isn't a unique id, then you can simply switch to post-increment.",0
5933,"depending on where the values for $id_member, $b_ref $id_doctor originate, your script could be open to sql injection .",0
5935,"mysqli supports them, as does pdo , which is simpler to use.",0
5936,"new code should use pdo, and old code should get updated over time.",0
5937,the body of your post request is encoded as application/json instead of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.,0
5938,(assuming that transaction is not a complex data type (like an array or object).,0
5940,"you should either use a string (to make it a selector: ""body"" ) or pass the body element directly: document.body .",0
5943,"if $_session['area'] is not set, php won't bother to test if $_session['area'] == $area because it doesn't need to (as the 1st condition is false anyway), it will try what is after the or",0
5945,there i ignore new line characters at the end of each line and skip empty lines.,0
5947,"using union , you can do 2 queries to get the results you want",0
5950,see also mysql: choosing an api guide and related faq for more information.,0
5951,"for starters, the pdo constructor throws an exception if there is an error.",0
5952,it does not return false .,0
5953,"secondly, as you are using sqlite, provided your dbase directory is writeable by the script, your connection attempt will create an empty database.",0
5955,use the one or the other.,0
5957,"i don't know much about codeigniter, but it's php, so shouldn't $_get still be available to you?",0
5958,you could format your url the same way google does: mysite.com/search?q=keyword and pull the data out with $_get['q'] .,0
5959,the first thing you need to do is define the actual pattern of words we're removing and put it into an array.,0
5961,"the fact that the numeric characters guarantee disqualification means that if you want to, you don't even have to use an ounce of regex, you can just stick them into the array by hand even.",0
5962,"if the value of your exploded array doesn't contain any of the patterns you've already used, toss it into a new array.",0
5963,trim() and stick a period on the end if you want.,0
5964,you forgot to call setcookie() .,0
5965,then it'll parse it (you can test it using parse_str() ) and place in $_post or $_get arrays (depends on form method).,0
5969,you can't access $_session variables before calling session_start .,0
5970,"also, your serializing of the data is probably pointless.",0
5971,serializing would be used if you wanted to dump the session state to a file or to a database or something.,0
5972,"you can implement this in two ways using mysql, the first one being a simple select from type of query:",0
5973,you can also do this by performing a check in the information_schema using the following statement:,0
5974,"lastly, you can call show tables like '&lt;table name&gt;'; and parse the results for a match, similar to the concept in the first example.",0
5975,"since you're using everything in one file &lt;form method=""post""&gt; is what gave it away, since the action defaults to ""self"" if omitted, therefore you need to use a conditional isset() or !empty() .",0
5976,"even if you were to split those up into two seperate files, it would be best to still use a conditional isset() or !empty() .",0
5977,it is used to check if a variable is set or not.,0
5978,'null' is the unique thing that uninitialized variables refer to.,0
5980,there is also the 'unset' state meaning the variable doesn't exist at all.,0
5981,you can check that via the isset() function .,0
5982,"most often used to check if an element of array exists and is, for example, a way to see if $_get['op'] has received a querystring param.",0
5983,you can also make a variable unset (remove an element of an array) via the unset() function .,0
5984,"there is also a function empty() which will check if a variable is either null, false, 0, or an empty string",0
5985,please do consider changing how the data is stored in the first place.,0
5987,$_session['id'] is a session variable named 'id'.,0
5990,the simple version isn't going to work for you because your array is so large.,0
5991,"it requires no array modification but may need to iterate the entire array, and that's a deal breaker.",0
5992,this approach is brilliant because isset() is very fast and the maximum number of isset() calls in the while loop can only be as many as the largest weight (not to be confused with limit) in the array.,0
5993,make sure the varaible $candname in your query is correct.,0
5994,"my best guest from you code is, you proberbly were supose to use $_post['candi_s_by_code'] instead of $candname try this",0
5995,if you dont want to change your select query try to add single quotatoion '$candname' around your php variable in select query.,0
5997,"so null will cause it to return false, as you would expect after reading the php manual for isset() .",0
5998,you don't need to escape \ the comma.,0
5999,a better approach might be to construct an array and then implode() :,0
6000,you can use a union to get the data from both tables.,0
6001,just be sure that you are returning matching columns in both queries.,0
6002,"so if in your first query you have the following data types int, text, varchar, decimal, decimal you will need to make sure that the second query gets those same column types otherwise the db will have a hissyfit about it.",0
6003,you can use an order by clause on the end to sort the data from both queries nicely.,0
6004,"edit: you can group_concat() fields in them if you want, and yes, you will be able to do an explode() on them in your php.",0
6005,"the default group_concat delimiter is a , (comma) so if you have commas in your fields, you will need to change it to something so that your explode works nicely.",0
6007,i think this solution will help you.,0
6008,"first, i supposed that there is a form inside your modal and you will submit it with your selected id .",0
6009,the modal body should be like this:,0
6010,"now, in the php file declared inside the form in the modal - which receives your post data, you can var_dump the $_post .",0
6011,"in your form you have &lt;select name='test[$id]'&gt; (one for each item), then when you submit the form you are getting $tests = $_post[""test""]; you don't need to specify the index in the form and can simply do &lt;select name='test[]'&gt; , you can eventually add a hidden field with the id with &lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""$id""/&gt; .",0
6012,the second part is the verification wich is not good at the moment; you can simply check if the itemalready exist in the database with a query,0
6013,you are not checking it correctly.,0
6014,you have to check if the entry in match_select exists for the user_id and the match_id concerned.,0
6015,"otherwise, $match would always be equal to the match_id field of the last inserted row in your database :",0
6017,it sounds like you simply want to mirror the behavior of the s3 demo on fineuploader.com.,0
6018,"so, the piece you are apparently having trouble with is the part of the demo that allows you to view/download the file you have uploaded.",0
6019,my guess is that you are not setting the param1 and param2 environment variables.,0
6020,you should really have a look at how the $_server super global works in the php documentation.,0
6021,"this code, as it stands, expects you to have a system environment variable named param1 that holds the public aws key associated with the iam user you should have created for your server (not your client) to use.",0
6023,"you can either set these environment variables, or set the associated $serverpublickey and $serverprivatekey php globals to the server-side iam user's public and secret keys, respectively.",0
6024,the $serverpublickey and $serverprivatekey variables should not be the same keys associated with the iam user you created for client-side tasks.,0
6025,you should have created a different iam user with permissions appropriate for server-side tasks.,0
6027,this user should be restricted to server-side tasks only for security reasons.,0
6028,"in your case, your server-side iam user must have ""s3:getobject"" permission on your bucket.",0
6029,this permission is required in order to get objects from your bucket.,0
6030,the safest approach is to only give this permission to your server-side iam user.,0
6031,"you're probably asking: ""if my client-side user can't read object from my bucket, how do i allow the file to be downloaded client-side?""",0
6032,"well, one option is to set the acl option in fine uploader to ""public-read"" and then construct a url client-side using this convention: "" http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/objectkey "".",0
6033,this is not the way the s3 demo on fineuploader.com work.,0
6034,"i didn't want to give users unlimited access to files they uploaded into fine uploader's s3 bucket, so i left the acl to ""private"" (the default value), i only gave my server-side iam user ""s3:getobject"" permission to the fine uploader s3 bucket, and i have the server return a ""time-bombed"" signed url to the associated object in the bucket.",0
6035,the url returned by the server contains an expiration parameter that only allows it to be used for 15 minutes.,0
6036,any attempts to change that expiration parameter in the query string will invalidate the signature and the request will fail.,0
6038,you can access this value by contributing a complete event handler .,0
6039,the responsejson object parameter passed into your callback will contain a templink property that will contain the signed url.,0
6040,you can then generate an anchor with the src attribute set to the value of this property.,0
6041,you need to make first value of exploded array as key and second as its value.,0
6043,"but if you have multiple form fields on the same page, and depending on the action, you want to submit different sets of those fields, then just wrap them in different &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; elements.",0
6045,"first, you probably want to use implode , and not explode, to construct your $tofield variable ;-)",0
6047,"then, on the php script that receives the data from the form when it's been submitted, you'd use explode to extract the data as an array, from the string :",0
6048,"also, if it's always going to be an integer, you could use:",0
6049,but you would need to be careful with things that evaluate to 0 and check for it in your if statement:,0
6052,"however, your comment seems to suggest that multiple checkboxes can be checked to rename a group?",0
6053,but then you don't have a form tag around it:,0
6054,"the challenge that you're going to have here is that you need to loop through that $_post['gid'] array, whereas the first single group rename you key off of the gid in the get .",0
6055,i would suggest organizing your code into a group / groups object(s) and use a model/view/controller (mvc) pattern to organize your code.,0
6056,are you saying that you can't get $_get['gid'] after you submit the group-in form?,0
6057,"because if that's the case, what you have to do is create a hidden input with your gid value so it can be available in $_post .",0
6058,"without putting much thought to what you're trying to do, i can tell you that you simply can't have code using $_get and $_post simultaneously.",0
6059,you need to quote each individual value of the array:,0
6061,"as far as if $data != '' goes, it is true if $data is not null , '' , false or 0 (loose comparison).",0
6062,true if the variable is set.,0
6063,the variable can be set to blank and this would be true.,0
6065,it is clearly not the same as isset .,0
6066,"if the variable does not equal an empty string, if the variable isnt set its an empty string.",0
6068,if ($data != '') { this is a string type safe of checking whether $data is not equal to an empty string,0
6069,if ($data) { this is a looking for true or false (aka: 0 or 1),0
6072,you are currently wide open to sql injection attacks .,0
6073,if it is in fact the column's name s_no.,0
6075,your present code is open to sql injection .,0
6080,also note that somethings you must escape (if user entered) are image locations etc,0
6081,then you might be accidentally deleting a user if you are logged in as admin.,0
6082,"of course, hopefully that sort of deletion is done with a post, but it can still be circumvented.",0
6083,"you can make it harder for an attacker by enforcing all data changing methods to be with a post, and you can make it almost impossible by generating a token for every delete action, and verifying it before deleting.",0
6084,neither of the last two variables are defined - you probably meant $this-&gt;username and $this-&gt;password .,0
6087,you also never call mysqldb() in the first place; you need to do that before attempting to insert into the database.,0
6090,"and then when you explode the teacher's name you will have their id on index 2 (last name, first name, id).",0
6091,note: i am not going to escape the data in the examples but you need to do that with mysqli or pdo,0
6092,and when a users loads a page you should check to see if the user still has a record and insert one if he/she doesn't like this:,0
6093,"then when you want to know how many people are logged in, you would do something like this:",0
6094,"while i recommend further validation, at a minimum you can wrap the code from genuser.php in a if(!empty($_post)){....}",0
6095,are all these files the same type?,0
6096,can you give us a var_dump of the variables when uploading a few files?,0
6097,are the variables for all uploads empty or just some?,0
6098,"in your second example, you have to construct the ""flipped"" value of $array before you can use isset() .",0
6099,"btw, you can also use array_flip() for that.",0
6101,"if you can't use the keys without conversion, you could consider using in_array() for small arrays.",0
6103,"lastly, and depending largely on the situation, you could use one of the array_intersect_ functions as well, mainly to avoid having to loop inside php code.",0
6105,you session_start() is inside a function called user_login() even though you are including the file my guess is you aren't calling the function user_login() every single page load as it is authenticating username and password.,0
6106,this is not the proper way to think of sessions.,0
6107,"you seem to be in the mindset that sessions, by their nature, are involved with authentication.",0
6108,"sessions merely persist data across multiple requests to php, and the fact that this is an ideal place to store the user's authentication state does not mean that it should only be started during authentication.",0
6109,"also, the name session_start() is a bit misleading because it does not 'start' a session so much as open one if it exists, or start a new one.",0
6110,the first invocation to session_start() will set a cookie in the user's browser with the phpsessid variable that is passed back in the $_cookie superglobal array on subsequent requests.,0
6111,"if session_start() detects this variable it loads the data from the server's session cache into $_session , but only when session_start() is called.",0
6113,"personally, all of my projects have the same 2 lines at the beginning of the global header:",0
6114,tl;dr: take session_start() out of that function [and anywhere else it might be] and move it to the top with your require() statements.,0
6115,"since your thread of else if blocks is followed by no else block to handle the case where none of them is executed, your script receiving an incorrect value for $_get['value'] or no value at all would result in $sql to not exist when you try to execute your query, which would explain both the errors you get.",0
6117,you are getting the notice because the index 8 (which you are trying to access) is not set to any value.,0
6119,this way the get parameters are reset on submit.you should post to $_server['php_self'].,0
6120,in case you work with non-stdclass object you could implement __tostring to use array_unique to filter.,0
6122,"from php 7 onwards you could use array_column to get a value from a stdclass, so if you use php7:",0
6123,in case there are more attributes to compare there are different ways.,0
6124,array_reduce is just one of them.,0
6125,the outcome of this one will not have any duplicates.,0
6127,you're comparing $_get['get'] with the (boolean) result of is_numeric() .,0
6128,this may be what you intend but i doubt it.,0
6129,"furthermore, i'm not sure if you can have expressions (i.e., non-simple language constructs) after the case keyword.",0
6130,edit based on the comments in the php manual it's possibly valid.,0
6131,and due to the loose comparison used by switch the above may actually reflect your intention.,0
6132,"if this is the case, please ignore my answer.",0
6133,"try echoing $_session['token'] into the form instead of $token , in case you accidentally re-assigned it between the creation of the token and the form output.",0
6135,also you should take a look at your where in your update query.,0
6137,your finaltime variable is never set.,0
6140,it is required at the top of each page before any output has started.,0
6142,i noticed that you haven't got an exit(); after your header(); you will need this so that if the user refreshes the login.php after login the browser won't resubmit the posted data to dologin.php,0
6144,"you're checking if (!empty($_session['user'])) , but before they've logged in, $_session['user'] should be empty.",0
6145,"in which case, they'll get the message ""you are already logged in.""",0
6146,"instead of a login form, but since there's no form, there's nothing to check, so there's no way to log in.",0
6149,you will probably want to use an isset() in the code too e.g,0
6150,you don't want to blindly import user input into your symbol table.,0
6151,you should take the time to validate and/or sanitize user input.,0
6153,"when inserting into a database, use the driver's escape mechanism to eliminate the possibility of injection.",0
6154,"if you're using mysql_* functions, you'd use mysql_real_escape_string.",0
6155,"however, it is much better to use pdo and parameterized queries for this.",0
6156,you need to check that username and password should not empty.,0
6157,"as it turns out, my code was completely fine, it was a missing space in the html of the remote site that got the simple php dom parser to not recognize the iframe i was looking for.",0
6158,i fixed it on my end by running a str_replace on the code first to replace the faulty code.,0
6159,"$rawmenuitem-&gt;note is an integer whereas $completedmenuitems is an array of objects containing an attribute called note .therefore, in_array() compares integers with objects.",0
6160,there are multiple solutions to this problem.,0
6161,one would be to roll his own function:,0
6164,furthermore you are ready to mysql injection .,0
6165,there is a nice tutorial here which explain you everything about that -> how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
6166,going through your script quickly you need to call mysql_query($sql) after,0
6167,suggestion since you have just begin ..i will suggest you try mysql_* for just conceptsbut use mysqli_* or pdo .. you shold also know about sql injection,0
6168,you must use cookie instead of session.,0
6170,"if you want to do this the right way , you can use init hook and setup your cookie data there.",0
6171,you can place that piece of code in your functions.php file.,0
6172,and then you can access $_cookie['your_cookie_name'] anywhere in your code.,0
6173,the string may have a hidden delete character (ascii 127) hidden in it.,0
6175,sometimes it's a simple encoding issue and encoding the string as utf-8 before running htmlspecialchars may fix it.,0
6177,i'll give you some pseudo code so you can find the logic:,0
6178,"the module(% symbol) means if the rest obtained dividing two numbers, 10/3 = 3 (+ 1) the 1 would be the module in this case, so you only print the tr's when the row is a multiple of 3. it's a pretty common practice, used also to do alternate row colors for example (using $rownumber%2);",0
6180,you need to send in the correct charset to htmlentities.,0
6181,"it looks like you're using utf-8, but the default is iso-8859-1.",0
6182,"another solution is to convert the text to iso-8859-1 before encoding, but that may destroy information (iso-8859-1 does not contain nearly as many characters as utf-8).",0
6183,"if you want to try that instead, do like this:",0
6187,use the element inspector inside your browser to see what you are sending.,0
6188,a good way to check what you are (not) sending is to print_r($_post);,0
6189,"also, you are using $body in your query, but you are not showing us the part of the code that populates $body .",0
6190,your taxonomy query parameters are not well formed.,0
6191,and you are not using any of your $_get variables either.,0
6192,"assuming you're getting the term id through the $_get , it should be something like:",0
6193,you would not need regular expressions here as it is a single task to do.just do the following.,0
6194,the function str_replace() can replace special characters by others.,0
6195,"the first parameter is a list of all the characters that need to be replaced, so here the - and the .",0
6196,and the second parameter is a line-break character to tell the characters that you want to replace to be replaced by a line-break.,0
6197,"you're currently setting $answer to isset($_post['answer'] , meaning as long as $_post['answer'] is set, you're $answer is going to be true .",0
6198,i would check if it's set and then set it to the $_post value.,0
6199,"pagination works using get-method, so this if(isset($_post['kivetes'])) will be false, you should use get-method for your form.",0
6201,nothing in your query has to change at that point.,0
6202,"this is not necessarily the end of the story, though, as mysql_real_escape_string is not invulnerable and you remain exposed to injection attacks by those using more sophisticated techniques.",0
6205,the best way to be sure you're doing it right is to use prepared statements with placeholder values.,0
6208,"this makes executing your statement later very easy, you just match up the values:",0
6209,so the best way to avoid injection bugs is to avoid injection in the first place.,0
6211,all it takes is one mistake where you thought you escaped something but you didn't and people can bust your site wide open.,0
6212,it's because your code is expecting a parameter named 'cartaction' in the url,0
6213,the get method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request.,0
6214,the page and the encoded information are separated by the ?,0
6223,in order to avoid this you could do this before checking the get value if (!,0
6224,edit: the actual error ended up being the assumption of needing to use $_get instead of the possibility of $_post for form data.,0
6225,the reason this isn't working is because you aren't unsetting from the original $data object.,0
6226,you can fix it one of two ways.,0
6227,either access by reference or update your unset to act on the original $data object instead.,0
6230,"if not, hard to detect errors occur.",0
6234,"there may be a way simpler fix for your problem, but if nothing else works you can also use explode() to cut the string in parts and create your array.",0
6236,what you're telling php to do is to find an entry in the array with key that matches your ip.,0
6240,personally i'd also recommend changing your sign out logic to use unset($_session) that way you only have to check for:,0
6241,it is not resulting due to undefined variable: _session error.,0
6242,so you can utilize any ignorant (@ or &amp;) ex.,0
6244,your ajax is working but you don't do anything with the response.,0
6245,instead you redirect to pdf.php .,0
6246,"when you redirect in the success handler, you are doing a completely separate http request, the post data is now gone from the previous request, that is why after the redirect $_post['html'] is empty.",0
6248,"when you submit your ajax request, the success callback is called with one argument contained the output you expect:",0
6249,"but, when you redirect to pdf.php , you are in effect sending another request.",0
6252,because http is a stateless protocol .,0
6253,that means one request to pdf.php is entirely different from another.,0
6254,"without the use of get, post, or session variables (cookies included), one request to pdf.php has no knowledge to any other requests to pdf.php .",0
6255,"also, i believe you are misusing ajax in this instance.",0
6256,the intent of ajax is to perform requests to the server without having to navigate to a new page.,0
6258,"ok, the only thing you would have to do is to replace &amp;nbsp; with a space as you already do (only if the string really still contains &amp;nbsp; check @andy e's answer to make sure that that your data does not contain any html entities.",0
6259,"is it possible you're ""double encoding"" any existing &amp;nbsp; parts of the string?",0
6260,"you call htmlentities on the string before html_entity_decode , so any existing &amp;nbsp; characters would become &amp;amp;nbsp; .",0
6263,"option here is to include javascript to set action in form on keyup and then, when you press submit, you will be redirected to this url.",0
6264,"if this is not what you want, please, tell us what your script need to do to get the correct answer.",0
6268,also your code is missing the actual query itself which is done using the following code:,0
6269,then the rest of your code will start to function:,0
6270,actually you don't need to do anything.,0
6271,"if there are extra elements in the exploded array, list won't care.",0
6272,seems that your php script are trying to read the 'selection' in your $_post variable but it wasn't defined yet.,0
6273,this should make fix your warning and there are differences between the array_key_exists.,0
6274,"in this case, use isset() because its faster and easier.",0
6277,the problem is when you do this : $('div.container-fluid').load('showcats.php'); a get request will be sent to the server!,0
6279,if you want to show/get the response you can use the success event like this:,0
6281,"you could do something like setting the session timeout to only a few minutes, but this will run the risk that someone who is a slow reader or takes their time moving from page to page will be locked out.",0
6282,"if you want to be a real meanie when it comes to user logouts, you might have to do something like javascript'ing in a regular ""check-in"" that sends data to the server to keep the session alive - this along with a short session time might sort-of achieve the result you are looking for.",0
6283,"edit: the code you posted also shows old mysql_* functions, along with root user and no password to access the database.",0
6284,please dead god tell me you just inserted that user as a placeholder.,0
6286,when they log into the admin functions and change it to false when they log out of the admin functions?,0
6287,"no need to kill off the entire session, just change a single variable kept in it.",0
6289,"try to use description[dayname] in the form and use $description=$_post[""description""][$dayz] in processing, you have array indexing issue because checkbox are just not send if not checked.",0
6291,where stopping the str_replace from working.,0
6292,to get around this i just searched for the html elements and put them in an array like so:,0
6293,"so no, you don't have to take care about escaping, server will take care about escaping for you.",0
6294,escaping manually will result in double escaped values.,0
6295,and in my personal opinion the greatest advantage of placeholders ?,0
6296,in sql statements is that you don't have to take care about escaping.,0
6297,you are never using it anyway since you overwrite the value in the while loop.,0
6299,"your output is not valid json that's the problem, your echo $_get['id']; is breaking your json output, remove it.",0
6300,if you want to send it in the output put it in the json response.,0
6301,it may not match because there is a new line between reported eta received: and the &lt;time&gt; tag.,0
6302,"and you've just put in there a space (use [\n\r\s\t]+ instead "" "").",0
6303,you can also use: ?p&lt;name&gt; for a easier pointing (associative vs numeric: numeric can change if you put more capture groups).,0
6304,"updated to reflect mysqli, instead of mysql and the mysql code to make it clearer.thanks @fred-ii- for point out.",0
6305,you need to set the $userrow variable after you invoke the function.,0
6306,"as this function returns this variable, if you have your $user object, just change:",0
6307,"also make sure you call session_start(); at the top, and that you instantiated the $user object: $user = new userclass (or whatever class name you have there).",0
6308,you dont need to use 8080 simply use localhost because that port number is not related to mysql but related to webserver.,0
6309,inorder to address the webserver only you need to use it like localhost:8080/project-name/,0
6311,but i prefer to go along with object oriented php.,0
6314,when you use the $name in your query use this mysql_real_escape_string($name) .,0
6316,you should change to mysqli or pdo,0
6317,either way it's an invalid query string since somevalue is not interpreted as a string.,0
6320,"your code would look something like this, if it was rewritten using mysqli:",0
6323,"otherwise quotes will not be added and the string will be misinterpreted as a token (also, there are sql injection concerns)",0
6324,"besides these points, it is important that you store passwords correctly in the database.",0
6326,"you need to store passwords as hashes, which are one-way functions that make it impossible (or at least harder) to obtain the password.",0
6327,i suggest you look into the crypt function in php.,0
6328,"used with the blowfish algorithm and a suitable salt, it can provide excellent security, but further details about this are outside the scope of this post.",0
6333,warning 2: it's also vulnerable to mail header injection attacks.,0
6335,you're inserting a literal string into the database.,0
6336,remove the double quotes - e.g.,0
6337,"also, you're prone to sql injection with that query.",0
6339,"first, if $codestadoconservacao is null then it will insert 'null' , as a string, literally the text null because of the quotation marks.",0
6340,it is not the same thing as mysql's null .,0
6341,"second, i see you grab this value from $_post and build your sql query with it without fearing consequences.",0
6342,you are about to be victim of sql injection / injeção de sql .,0
6345,"setcookie() passes a set-cookie http header to the webserver, which in turn transfers it to the client.",0
6347,whether they're accepted/ignored is irrelevant - you can send any header you want.,0
6349,"but if you do output first, before calling setcookie, you'd end up with something like this:",0
6350,headers are only headers when they're in the header block of the response.,0
6351,"if they show up in the body, they're not a header - they're part of the content.",0
6352,"that's why php issues the ""headers already sent"", and doesn't send the cookie.",0
6353,it can't - the train has already left the station.,0
6354,"this variant packs whole css into a single line,removes all css comments as well, and checks if $partdetails[1] is actually isset at the end, and than goes the imploding *(last else )",0
6355,"as a result, you will have the following variables with the following values:",0
6356,"since you are creating an array of array in php, hence json_encode is giving you array of array of objects.",0
6358,"first, mysql_query is a deprecated php function and should be replaced with mysqli_query.",0
6359,all functions in your code should use the mysqli prefix instead of mysql (so mysql_fetch_assoc should be changed to mysqli_fetch_assoc ).,0
6360,"this function also takes a parameter providing a connection to the database, which is done with mysqli_connect.",0
6365,update mysql to mysqli or pdo use prepared statements optimize code for speed (use || instead of |) use a stronger hashing algorithm,0
6366,leave a comment if you want a more in depth instruction to improve your code,0
6367,this is a great article about pdo.,0
6368,but pdo is object based and since you're new to php and i don't know your skill level you can better use mysqli for now.,0
6369,there're plenty of articles available on how you can do this.,0
6373,you should use bcrypt or at least use an individual salt for each password you encrypt with sha1 and store that next to the password in the database,0
6375,it is easier to work with sessions first and if you really need it cookies later.,0
6376,if you're using sessions you should also check if the session_id hasn't been set by an attacker in the clients browser.,0
6377,you can do this by setting a random cookie such as init and when this is not set you call,0
6378,you store both the email and the hashed password in a cookie.,0
6380,the best practice is to hash a randomly created string of characters with a high entropy and store only that in the cookie and in the database.,0
6382,to fix your error you should remove the while loop around the mysql_fetch_array($check),0
6383,your code looks a lot more organized if you start to learn to work with php objects.,0
6384,this can also make your project a lot easier to work with.,0
6385,i don't know if you're going to use this code in a production website because i highly recommend against that.,0
6386,you can better use a safe and sound solution that somebody with more experience has created and when you have more experience you can start building your own.,0
6387,"longer-er answer: when possible you should use prepared statements with bound parameters (as oli charlesworth said), however, the second best option is to use the escaping mechanism specific to a specific rdbms.",0
6388,"in this case, you would use mysql_real_escape_string instead of addslashes.",0
6390,addslashes is a glorified str_replace of ' with \'.,0
6391,mysql_real_escape_string is a hook into the mysql client library's mysql_real_escape_string function.,0
6392,"it is aware of a few settings on the server (hence the connection parameter to it), and it is safer than addslashes.",0
6393,bound parameters are still safer though.,0
6394,"even though mysql_real_escape_string knows a lot about the connection and so on, a lot of factors can contribute to the security of it.",0
6395,"for example, character sets and encodings can be difficult to handle.",0
6396,"bound parameters have a different method of operation, and they do not do escaping like normal queries.",0
6397,"as such, they are safer as there is less room for error on things like character encoding and what not.",0
6398,i can tell that $_post is a sort of 'reserved array'.,0
6399,so do not use it as a 'custom array'.,0
6400,"it generates automatically when a form ""posts"" its fields' values.",0
6401,then your action.php takes form's values as an array called $_post .,0
6402,"then now, i might answer you that redeclaring $_post as an array sounds purposeless:",0
6403,"however, you might use $_post in this manner into your action.php file, at least treating it as an array:",0
6406,you can use parse_url() to break up the url and then match it with preg_match() :,0
6407,"you are using print_r , but domnodelist does not offer any output for that function (because it's an internal class).",0
6409,in the end you need to iterate over the node list and deal with each node on your own.,0
6410,"in order to use the $_get variable, it must be in the query string (or being routed through some other means that isn't 'default').",0
6411,"if you want get only id inserted query, you can use lastinsertid() function of pdo.",0
6412,"you're testing for the presence of various $_post variables, and if you find them all you set some local variables against them.",0
6414,you're using trim(strip_tags()) as some form of sanitization.,0
6415,this is nowhere near good enough.,0
6416,"you should use mysql_real_escape_string() (for mysql), or consider moving to prepared statements.",0
6418,you might want to look at the manual entry for pdo::errorinfo() .,0
6421,"i will run a very quick example, but i think you'll need to read up on the differences between mysql and mysqli (there are many websites with good advise, please google)",0
6422,your mysqli would be best in the form of object orientated and you would have a mysqli object which contains your connection data:,0
6424,now you can use $database as your mysqli connection to your database.,0
6425,"first, set your 5 parameters as an array (as mentioned by codrutz codrutz) thus:",0
6426,"now you have all your parameters in $parameters , you can edit your original query to look through the five (or however many) parameter rows given.",0
6427,"the first part of the bind_param is the type of data that is being bound - (s)tring, (i)nteger, (d)double [numeric] or (b)lob [file/big chunks].this binds the values in the inner array to the ?",0
6429,"to reverse the array as you want you can still array_reverse but the data is selected by name, and should be referenced as such.",0
6430,$vartitle = $_post['title']; it worked for dropdown to.,0
6432,in case you want the selected text then you have to put it in some hidden field on the selection change and get the value of that hidden field on form submit.,0
6435,you can limit the usage per user per hour in mysql: link security mysql,0
6438,one of the best answers is in how can i prevent sql-injection in php?,0
6439,first do a preg_match and find the matching names.,0
6440,then craete the array with replacements for every found name.,0
6441,"then use preg_replace with the array as second argument, thereby replacing the names with the items from the array.",0
6445,"you have a 2d array, an array of array.",0
6447,"but be careful, only same key/value pairs are considered identicals.",0
6449,"generally, coding practices in php prefer to use foreach instead of a for iterator unless one actually needs the count as we pass through, ostensibly why the fetch is done as fetch_num , although it is never used.",0
6450,my friend your code is just fine you just need to check that your submiting the dropboxes with the form so first check your html and when you var_dump($_request) it should be an array containing all the values that you trying to gather,0
6451,"split the string at , into an array ( explode() ) remove all leading and trailing whitespaces ( trim() ) from every array element ( array_map() ) just iterate and output.",0
6453,make sure you're passing the right value to session::exists() .,0
6455,have a reference from following queries.,0
6456,"to fix this, check that the variable that you're passing in as the needle has an actual value.",0
6457,the empty function is a good choice for that.,0
6458,"it may be, then, that you are receiving white space (e.g.",0
6459,a space or newline) from your form without realising it.,0
6460,"in this case, you can filter your $_post variable like so:",0
6462,"if the string is small, why not use explode() to explode it at the tags,and replace the strings in required fragments, and then rejoin it ?or try domdocument :",0
6463,"as a workaround, you can make file_get_contents send a user-agent header in your script.",0
6464,setting a value for the user_agent configuration value at runtime using ini_set should suffice.,0
6465,"whether or not you need to send a specific user-agent (one like a common browser would send), or if just any value is enough, you have to try and see.",0
6467,"if that doesn’t work, or you need to send any additional headers, then please refer to this so question: php file_get_contents() and headers",0
6468,"edit: using curl of course you got the same problem, unless you specify a user-agent so that this api will not fail.",0
6469,you can do that using curl_setopt and the curlopt_useragent option.,0
6470,your notice is coming from echo $_session['cart_1'] .,0
6471,and you are not using isset() there.,0
6473,when using pdo you can do it like this:,0
6474,you can safely put a header() -redirect in the dosomethingwheninsertwassuccessful() function.,0
6475,"unless your application writes any output beforehand, there is no reason why this would not work.",0
6476,"the issue is not with php or pdo, i was able to reproduce the issue directly with mysql.",0
6480,here's one way to do it assuming that's right:,0
6481,"i assume you want to match what's inside the brackets, which means that you must match everything but a closing bracket:",0
6485,the same applies to all the child arrays.,0
6486,"what you want to do instead, since you seem to have an array of children, is to loop through that array and pick up each child's info to add to the email.",0
6487,"another alternative, if you don't want to loop through all those arrays, is to use the print_r function with its second optional parameter set to true .",0
6489,"make sure you have provided all the correct values for all the parameters (host,username,password,dbname) in",0
6490,gets first 300 chars and checks for broken tag.,0
6492,if not broken just strip and get rest.,0
6493,there is at least 1 problem:,0
6496,"i think for such a small string, and if the format will always be the same, you could use array_push and substr to get extract the numbers out of the string and put them in an array.",0
6498,this is an array and you can grab out the aff value by doing:,0
6499,in your case you can use this to update your query:,0
6502,"i think the problem is that lines in email have a maximal length, therefore either phpmailer or the mail transport program breaks long lines.",0
6503,"to avoid that, you could use base64 encoding: this way the base64 code will be broken into short lines, which does not affect the encoded string.",0
6504,"as i see, phpmailer does not allow setting the message body encoding, but you can send the ical as an attachment.",0
6505,but you already have what you need in an array; might as well loop over it and create your query:,0
6507,and that's because it has to cross this if(isset($_post['editar'])){ ... block to reach the former mentioned if block.,0
6508,"the solution is, take this entire if(isset($_post[""editarreceta""])){ ... } outside of the if(isset($_post['editar'])){ ... } block, like this:",0
6509,"also, to get the $id value in the update query, you have to change the form's action attribute in the following way,",0
6510,"so that you could catch the appropriate $id in the following way,",0
6512,also see how you can prevent sql injection in php .,0
6513,"explode() the string, then use two nested loops along with array_slice() to get the relevant elements.",0
6514,"for even quite short strings, the memory and runtime requirement will explode.",0
6515,even in native code this is a scary performance problem.,0
6517,the big trick with my code above is the use of reset() which resets an array and returns (the first element).,0
6519,"next, we just loop through all contents of this first infobox and access the key and value keys directly.",0
6520,"you if want to access both keys and values, a simple good ol' foreach will do.",0
6521,"no, you can't use prepared statement between calls.",0
6522,"no, it is not worth nor necessary in order to run the same query across different requests.",0
6524,your approach (remove values from the names and websites arrays using the non-unique values of the email arrays) is unnecessary.,0
6525,"by looking at the arrays you provided, you can simply use the array_unique function in every array, as i did above.",0
6526,"also, it is a best practice to have an user data in the same array.",0
6528,a part of the confusion with the transaction statuses is that the transaction status object is built off of a similar object that we use internally and includes ever possible transaction status in our system.,0
6529,some of these status will effectively never actually be seen by you as an external developer.,0
6531,i'm working with our internal developers just to confirm some details on the statuses and i'll reply with that list as soon as i can.,0
6532,i can answer the rest of your questions right now.,0
6533,"within authorize.net, all transactions are moved into a batch when the transaction state is final.",0
6534,this is a significant difference in the authorize.net definition of a batch and the definition used by most merchant services provider.,0
6535,"because all of our reporting is organized into batches, it is important that all of your transactions ultimately end up in a batch.",0
6536,other errors - communicationerror - an individual transaction was rejected by the processor.,0
6537,this is a final transaction status.,0
6538,- settlementerror - a day's batch was rejected by the processor.,0
6539,the merchant should try to recover the batch.,0
6540,- general error - this is a catch-all status for any transaction status that is not otherwise defined.,0
6542,they should not be returned by the transaction details api.,0
6543,you haven't encoded the data you are sending as json.,0
6544,you are passing an object to jquery and allowing it to encode it (as application/x-www-form-urlencoded ).,0

6594,brute force attacks can be mitigated by using proper hashing.,0
6596,you can also check out this discussion for a little more information on this.,0
6597,if you want to match a string anywhere in the field content you can just use a like operator:,0
6598,depending on your table collation the strtoupper and upper statements might be redundant (generally if the collation has _ci at the end of it the comparison would be performed in a case insensitive manner).,0
6599,if you columns are varchars and hence you are expecting to receive string values you need to wrap your values in single-quotes.,0
6603,then in that code block you try to use $_session['user'] in your query.,0
6604,you are trying to use a variable you know doesn't exist (and has no value).,0
6605,you are currently making no attempt to serialize the data array into a format that can be properly handled by both $.ajax() and your php script.,0
6606,when you try to rely on jquery's default object to query string conversion with code like this:,0
6609,"in the index.php on the first line i have -> remove that, put first routine of session checking",0
6610,"there is no difference as long as you are using both libraries properly.there was one quite theoretical vulnerability in the older versions of pdo, fixed two years ago.",0
6616,well if you want to remove the $_get vars from the url,0
6617,"i'm a bit confused about what you are asking, but i'm assuming you want to make unos into an array.",0
6618,you can do that like this:,0
6619,then in order to access them via php just use $_post['unos'][$n] where $n is an integer.,0
6620,you can also loop over $_post['unos'],0
6623,actually mysql_real_escape_string() is used while sanitize a input from a user.,0
6626,that's maybe because you do not empty your session variable.,0
6628,"then, on the second load, if you are putting a message on $_session['error2'] , you will also have the message of error1 because the session keep your data.",0
6629,according to what properties are there in $r you can output them.,0
6630,"if there is a better solution to this problem, or if i'm creating other issues i'm just not aware of yet, please comment.",0
6631,for now my problem has stopped.,0
6634,or alternatively you don't have to store $lastid at all if you access it within your sql:,0
6636,file() function will return file contents as an array of strings (if no error occurred).,0
6637,the first line in that array is in the default starting position ( 0 ).,0
6638,"so, this condition should be considered when getting the expected range.",0
6639,for such input boundaries: from 4 - to 8 - it should be: from 3 - to 7 to get range of elements(strings) from array use array_slice function:,0
6641,this example code is provided to demonstrate the api concept.,0
6642,"try changing your initial $item['date'] to be 2012,04,30 if that's what you're trying to do.",0
6643,otherwise i'm not entirely sure what you're trying to print.,0
6644,i would use a combination of array_merge() and array_splice() .,0
6645,lets assume that $fixed contains an array of fixed element's keys (from $arrayone ).,0
6646,starttag = change its string to the default string before of the word you want to extract.,0
6648,assuming the postcodes in your database are correctly formatted (i.e.,0
6649,"containing the spaces), then you'll need to do some validation of the user input (this is a good idea anyway).",0
6650,"once you've validated the user input, you can easily format the postcode so that you can look it up in your database.",0
6651,"however, if the data in your database isn't so clean, then you'll need to work out a way to either (a) improve the data quality, or (b) search the table using a regular expression:",0
6653,see this question: why shouldn&#39;t i use mysql_* functions in php?,0
6656,"okay so after a lot of trial and error, my co-workers and i managed to get things up and running.",0
6657,the most time-consuming part turned out to build the wrapper.,0
6659,"also, my wrapper's called pdovertica so whenever you see this term, you have to substitute it for the name of your own wrapper.",0
6660,"2) next, you need to modify a couple of files:",0
6662,"so far as i could tell, this was all the steps needed to get laravel to connect to a vertica database without crashing.",0
6665,if you are using two different apis (i.e.,0
6666,"mysql_* and pdo), php will generate two different connections.",0
6667,"the mysql extension creates keys of the form ""mysql_&lt;host&amp;port&gt;_&lt;user&gt;..."" while pdo builds ""pdo:dbh:dsn=&lt;dsn&gt;:&lt;user&gt;:...."" .",0
6668,the hashes are used almost like array-keys in a php script.,0
6679,personally i prefer to err on the side of caution and bind all variables that aren't hard-coded into the script to the queries and properly escape everything before echoing it to the browser so that i never have to think about what else might be manipulating the values along the way.,0
6681,i couldn't find a table names *_reports in moodle-1.9 or moodle-2.0.,0
6682,"if get_course_students give you the userids, then you can use",0

6685,"try any of the above, until you find simething that works... incidentally, if all you want to remove is &lt;tag&gt; and &lt;/tag&gt; , why not go for the much faster:",0
6686,"if you want to isolate the actual contents as defined by your pattern, you could use preg_match($regex,$text,$hits); .",0
6688,"you can then start manipulating these found matches, possibly using htmlspecialchars ... and combine them again into $code .",0
6689,"the problem is, that your variable $cart_id is not defined.",0
6690,"with this, you first check if the variable is set, and if it's set you check if it isn't empty.",0
6692,furthermore $tablename is never defined unless its in the file you're including.,0
6693,i think you mean to reference a result from the query but to do that you need to do:,0
6695,this is valid for php 5.x only.,0
6697,"don't do anything with it, insert it as-is.",0
6698,"and use bindvalue, bindparam is an optimization thing when you have a lot of data you need to change fast when loop-executing a statement..",0
6702,"also, unless you are going to use the variable $ting again later, you can cut out the middle-man.",0
6704,"after setting the cookie, you can check if it's empty:",0

6720,"and you also found a lot of or die('some errormessage); statements, also not a good idea in production for obvious reasons.",0
6725,the intval is for prevention of sql injection attacks.,0
6726,the second solution is not common because you'd have to include the whole bootstrapping into every single content script.,0
6728,your first example is prefered but as you said it's very static and uncomfortable for many pages.,0
6729,so you'd like to store this in an array in a file or in the database.,0
6730,"if you want mod_rewrite support or nginx rewrites, you can enforce redirecting /index.php?page=x to /x then have to adjust your stored current page value in database.",0

6738,essentially what you are saying is this,0
6739,the original code is flawed the original code is correct ( in this case $id should be a new variable ),0
6740,"without seeing the entire code for this page, it's impossible to tell if that $groepsindeling is even related to the query or just used somewhere else.",0
6741,the other possibility as i mentioned is that they are the same and the orignal code is bugged.,0
6742,"as a side note, in current php versions this $_get[id] from the original query will likely throw a undefined constant warning, i've seen this used before in pre 5.3 php code.... it should be $_get['id'] .",0
6743,it still works because php will give an undefined constant the string representation of its name.,0
6744,( just a way to tell how old the code is :-p ),0
6745,"and one last note is you are using mysql_query with mysqli_real_escape_string so that i in there has some meaning, or the lack of it in this mysql_query .",0
6747,i am not sure if there is any significant difference between mysql_real_escape_string and mysqli_real_escape_string,0
6748,"the console is logging the variable you are sending not what you're receiving, that is why it looks correct.",0
6749,if you log response then you'd see a problem.,0
6750,for the php part you're reading $_post['data'] when you should be reading $_post['numeform'] becuse that is what you sent in your ajax request,0
6751,"using a for loop, you can access the $_post keys with a variable, as in $_post[""widget$i""]",0
6752,"however, a better long-term solution would be to change the html form such that it passes an array back to php in the first place by adding [] to the form input's name attribute:",0
6756,"or you can do explode and and implode exploded array, after unsetting array key 0, like so",0
6757,"or if you want to get just part ""value"" from your string, just use list",0
6758,in your current code your concatenation was off for displaying the $row data.,0
6759,you also were open to sql injections.,0
6762,the problem occurs when you load the page at the beginning.you start the session and you include the nav.php where you start the session once again.,0
6763,if you load the page for the second time the page is independent of the parent and the session can be started again.,0
6764,i'd suggest using preg_replace() for this rather than str_replace() .,0
6765,"the reason is that there may be multiple newlines and combinations of \r and \n , and i would expect that you'd want to replace them all with just a single comma.",0
6766,"your data is not in the $_post array, because your angular js contenttype is set to application/json by default, and php expects application/x-www-form-urlencoded for a post request.",0
6768,also there is no way to see if the the final query generated by pdo.,0
6769,i will recommend to use mysqli library to use in such scenarios.,0
6770,i usually encounter such issues during complex joins or executions of custom triggers.,0
6771,if you want to go ahead with object oriented code you can use mysqli class or also you could use simple procedural approach.,0
6773,"but if you use mysqli wisely and properly check sql injections when you input, then there will not be a problem.",0
6777,"if you cannot decide, this article will help to choose.",0
6780,or you can implode it to make one and unique string :,0
6781,you should not be using htmlentities here.,0
6782,remove that and the html_entity_decode .,0
6783,there is a php function called explode that does exactly what you want.,0
6784,the explode function does the splitting and returns the array that you want.,0
6785,you can try using different charset arguments to see if any works.,0
6786,"then you submit the form, it ties that into the original sessionid, checks your authentication, and either logs in the original session, or creates you a new one, and updates yours (normally with a http set-cookie command you can see in the network log).",0
6787,"what tipped me off to my problem was identifing that by the time i was about to submit a form, with a particular sessionid, that sessionid, was no-longer valid.",0
6788,"hence i failed the replay checks, and i got an error similar to yours.",0
6789,"it turned out in my case it was to do with the databases replicating in a way that didn't match how they were being accessed downstream so i could attempt to access a session, that hadn't been created yet.",0
6790,"looking at all your code, the sessionids don't match.",0
6791,"wptokenlogin starts with 510a85 but your wiki session in setcookie starts with n7gs0c and in your log it talks about 6ov933 ... so assuming you copied/pasted from different attempts, you need to run through it yourself from a clean state and check that everything looks like it's using the same session.",0
6792,"if not, try to figure out what's happening to the session you have (if it's created/changed) or why you're not getting the right one, if it's created but never passed out to you properly.",0
6793,"that said, i just took at look at the client side of logging into our own inhouse version of mediawiki, and wplogintoken , wikidb_session and jsessionid don't match either (although i'd expect one of them to show up in the wiki log, which i don't have access too).",0
6794,"if you have to, grep the source for the error message you're finding, and insert error_log(__file__.':'.__line__.'",0
6796,"there is a setting in php.ini called session.cookie_secure , but mediawiki ignores this flag.",0
6798,prepare() method returns false if there is an error as stated here .,0
6799,you should keep it in an if statement.,0
6800,your query string will not interpret the variable $tbl_name because you are using single quotes.,0
6801,it could be fixed with '.$tbl_name.',0
6805,this error is because you have declared class name as goodgirls1database and you have also implemented a method named goodgirls1database in that class.,0
6806,try changing either the name of the method or the class name.,0
6807,you are passing the wrong order of parameters in mysqli_select_db() .,0
6808,it appears as though you are making a pdo connection but using mysql_ functions.you should have your code written like this instead.,0
6809,"your original code was susceptible to sql injection, which is not good.",0
6810,"i would also not reccommend using $_post[""log in""] because it is terrible practice to have spaces in an array key.",0
6812,"since you are using the procedural form of the mysqli_ functions, you need to pass a mysqli link identifier as the first argument in mysqli_select_db() , mysqli_real_escape_string() , mysqli_query() and mysqli_error() (see also the documentation for more details).",0
6814,the modified code should look something like this:,0
6815,"this will iterate through every item in the array $_post['addbox'] and give you its $key in the array and the item's $itemid , or value (which you made the item id).",0
6817,warning: you usually want to prevent against malicious clients with sanity and validity checks.,0
6818,there are some good answers already on stackoverflow for preventing sql injection.,0
6819,"you also need to check for empty, invalid characters, overflowing numbers, etc.",0
6820,"this snippet, as it stands now is vulnerable and can cause problems if $key or $itemid contain unintended values (including being not set or empty).",0
6821,its done with mod_rewrite and the router part of the script:,0
6822,you've got a lot of poor php syntax in your example.,0
6835,on the other hand you can also redirect the users to login page if they are not logged in using header(),0
6836,"so for example if you don't want user to see a page called admin.php than on that page at the very top you can specify the condition, if it's false you can redirect",0
6837,"since we're talking about post variables, don't assume they're exactly as you want them.",0
6838,"keep in mind that $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('field') returns false when the index is not present; that might well brake your if condition.assuming you need numbers to do this, you can do a check like",0
6839,"and yeah, ok, maybe you can write a cleaner code than mine, but you get the picture ;)",0
6840,you don't seem to quite understand how long the variables stay in memory.,0
6842,"if you want to use values from a form when next the user posts a form (the next request made), then you're already half-way there, try:",0
6843,"before you can use the session, you'll always have to call session_start .",0
6844,"assuming there's no need to keep the data around after you're finished processing the third form, session_destroy is worth a look.",0
6845,"but anyhow, after storing the data in the session, the id value will be available to you as long as the session is valid.",0
6846,check the manual for more on sessions .,0
6847,"you could use a cookie, too.",0
6848,"since you're using get, i take it you're not passing any sensitive or crucial data anyway, so setcookie would do the job, too.",0
6849,"refer to the values using the $_cookie super-global, then.",0
6851,this makes them vulnerable (can be tempered with) and unreliable (client can disable/reject your cookie),0
6852,because you're passing it the value instead of the key.,0
6853,"the key is $i , so the second line should be",0
6855,also i suggest you to use mysqli.,0
6856,it is pretty similar to mysql.,0
6857,"first, you're definitely on the right track with the separate file for each class.",0
6858,this is pretty much considered standard practice at this point.,0
6859,i would look into class autoloading and spl_autoload_register .,0
6860,"i highly recommend setting up an autoloader first thing, trust me when i say you really don't want to have to do countless interface_exists and class_exists calls before you include your class files.",0
6861,i answered a similar question here but the basic gist is that you create a single database instance and inject that into the classes needing database access.,0
6862,"as far as mysqli , if that is what you like using go for it.",0
6863,"its awesome that you aren't using the older, deprecated mysql_* .",0
6864,i wouldn't use array_push here if you are in a loop anyway.,0
6866,perhaps you have a typo with your $durgs_value_current when var_dump() 'ing it?,0
6867,calling var_dump($undefined_variable) will result in a null and if you have error reporting turned of or are suppressing e_notice's from logs then you won't receive an undefined variable error.,0
6868,remove the '@' before $_post and you should be fine.,0
6869,"however, your current script looks like it's vulnerable to sqli.",0
6870,and you are also using a deprecated extension.,0
6871,you should consider using mysqli or pdo instead.,0
6873,i can't use php functions inside the array - boring and i'd missed the : off adf_add2.,0
6876,"the last query you dont show any code for, so.. im a little lost.",0
6877,"i get the impression you wanted to explode the text of a given article, and then see if 5 or more tags it has appear in the cateogry.",0
6878,"if so, i dont see this code doing that.",0
6880,"i don't know if content-type is correct, normally api's use ""content-type: application/json""",0
6881,i just had to test it on my server to see if it works.,0
6882,"so i added the $post_type variable that should return the post type, and then i just put that in your class in the &lt;article&gt; tag, so you can differentiate :)",0
6885,assign the result of explode to a variable and pass that variable to end :,0
6886,"the problem is, that end requires a reference, because it modifies the internal representation of the array (i.e.",0
6887,it makes the current element pointer point to the last element).,0
6888,"', $file_name) cannot be turned into a reference.",0
6889,"this is a restriction in the php language, that probably exists for simplicity reasons.",0
6891,you however pass the result of explode() directly to end() without saving it to a variable first.,0
6892,"at the moment when explode() returns your value, it exists only in memory and no variable points to it.",0
6893,"you cannot create a reference to something (or to something unknown in the memory), that does not exists.",0
6894,"or in other words: php does not know, if the value you give him is the direct value or just a pointer to the value (a pointer is also a variable (integer), which stores the offset of the memory, where the actual value resides).",0
6895,so php expects here a pointer (reference) always.,0
6898,please have a look on below.,0
6899,if you want to explode a file name.,0
6900,"your month and year &lt;select&gt; boxes have name=""q"" so only the last one (year in this case) is passed to your php.",0
6901,i was able to solve this problem by using a slight delay in the refresh header.,0
6902,"we set the header (which must be done before any methods which might output, like setcookie), and then set the cookies.",0
6904,"as far as i can tell, this follows the algorithm described in your link, and should work correctly.",0
6905,(apart from the syntax error you have in the definition of $suffixesa - you're missing a couple of apostrophes.),0
6906,"you can also combine those two str_replace s into one: $word = str_replace(array('j','v'), array('i','u'), $word); , or, since you're replacing single characters with single characters, you can use $word = strtr($word,'jv','iu'); - but i don't think that will make much difference in practice.",0
6907,you'll have to try it out to be certain.,0
6908,furthermore i adjusted the arrays so they can be used more effective.,0
6909,"i changed the $quewords array so it can be used for a fast hash-table lookup, not a slow in_array .",0
6911,"thus you don't need to compute them at runtime (which is really, really slow).",0
6913,"i don't know how much faster this code is, but it should be much faster.",0
6914,furthermore it now works on the examples provided.,0
6915,the mysqli_connect() needs to be told what database you want to connect to.,0
6916,remember mysql can run 100's of databases simaltaneously.,0
6917,"now both objects reference each other, but they are both not referenced from anywhere else, so they are unreachable.",0
6918,"this is, what the circular-reference gc tries to detect, but to find them, it iterates over every known object and finds out, if there is a reference ""from outside"".",0
6919,"its a little bit more complicated, but simplified thats it ;) so in structures with many references, espcially circular ones, it is a huge task.",0
6920,i think you missed the mysqli package in this server.,0
6921,"if apt-get says it is already installed try to do a ping to localhost, if don't resolve edit /etc/hosts and check the line where localhost points to 127.0.0.1should be there, if not, your server its horribly configured!",0
6922,"just adding this since i didn't think it was clear, but the problem is definitely your production version of php.",0
6924,"if $sql is empty, that means your $time is empty; have you tried to check what is the value ?i think your $time=$_post['tar']; might be returning null from the form or at least not one of the case you tried.",0
6925,"you are trying to access an associative array of arrays(multidimensional) with $row['trend'] etc... while you don't have it, as indicated in your first var_dump.",0
6926,your first var_dump should look like this:,0
6927,you should always use the session_start() function.,0
6929,but putting custom objects in the session is dodgy and something i would generally try to avoid.,0
6930,"to be able to do it you have to have defined the class in question before calling session_start ; if you don't, php's session handler won't know how to deserialise the instances of that class, and you'll end up with the __php_incomplete_class object .",0
6931,"if you must take this approach, make a copy of the data from $_session into a local $mysession array.",0
6932,"however, i have to say i think the whole idea of a safestring is dangerous and unworkable; i don't think this approach is ever going to be watertight.",0
6933,"whether a string of raw text is ‘safe’ is nothing to do with where it came from, it is a property of how you encode it for the target context.",0
6934,"if you get another text string from a different source such as the database, or a file, or calculated within the script itself, it needs exactly the same handling as a string that came from the user: it needs to be htmlspecialchars ​ed.",0
6935,you're going to have to write that escape anyway; the safestring gains you nothing.,0
6936,"if you need to send the string to a different destination format, you would need a different escape.",0
6937,you just have to include the safestring.class.php before you call session_start() when you want to read the safestring objects from $_session variable:,0
6938,"and yeah, if you are using php framework that (most probably) calls session_start() internally, make sure you require_once the class file beforehand (use hooks or whatever mechanisms that the framework provides).",0
6939,"i know it's been years since this was asked, but i'm posting my answer because none of the answers above actually explain to the op what is actually wrong.",0
6940,"if you don't want your session objects to convert to __php_incomplete_class , you can do it by either requiring the class files before you invoke session_start , or by registering an autoload function.",0
6941,"the problem is that you explode at the char % and not at the char ,.i think what you need is:",0
6945,you don't need to call pdo::query() .,0
6946,"for a prepared statement, you call pdo::prepare() , then pdostatement::execute() performs the query and you can retrieve the result using pdostatement::fetch* .",0
6947,"if you need ids then fetch them from db and return in ajax call (i guess this is the id you are talking about).from this point you can use something like this, that you cache the returned results in e.g.",0
6948,associative array:$arr[value] = id;and if user selects one of the values you can get the corresponding id.that's one method i guess.,0
6949,btw.some tips for the future:1. the id's fields should have unique values.2.,0
6951,here you do not even escape the string which is given by the user.3.,0
6953,"yes it's relatively safe to do, as long as you have full access control over your server (no shared hosting whatsoever).",0
6954,"seriously, your code contains a serious vulnerability called sql injection .",0
6957,"yes, it does require you to possible do 2 queries in a request, but it's the only way to ensure you get the result you need.",0
6959,"you can call $.ajax() directly, but for most cases, you can use one of the convenience wrappers.",0
6961,"so, let's say your php file is called detail_ajax.php and it returns the html you wish to put in your div (with class data ).",0
6962,all you would have to do then is this:,0
6963,"if you want to pass data to detail_ajax.php , you can pass it along this way:",0
6965,"however, 3 things will need to take place for this to happen as you intend.",0
6966,"first, we need a reference held in the html that is generated by the table so we can streamline the server request.",0
6967,"when you generate the table, add a unique data-name string to the td.",0
6968,"now, we need to detect the request on our page so we can properly return the data to the browser, we'll look for $_get['name'] as per your example.",0
6969,now we need to employ ajax to bridge the gap between the server and the browser.,0
6970,produces a cartesian product between cars and customers .,0
6972,"to avoid this, you need a join.",0
6973,"if you will always have at least one sold car per customer (ie, it's a sales database), then use an inner join .",0
6975,this will cause all of the car columns to contain null if there's not a corresponding record.,0
6977,you problem is quite simple: you are using explode on the wrong thing.,0
6978,if your code/comments is right $products is an array and you explode it.,0
6979,"you probably have your php error level too low because this produce a php warning: php warning: explode() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in php shell code on line 1",0
6980,so from there 2 solutions: either $products is an array of strings and you can do,0
6981,or $products is an array of objects (as your code comment suggests) and you go with:,0
6982,"remote_host usually contains the result of a reverse dns lookup and can also be done in php using gethostbyaddr in the case, that your server does not fill this environment variable.",0
6983,"it gets derived from the $_server['remote_addr'] value, which represents the (ip)-address as its name suggests.",0
6985,assuming you are using a shared host i would not let the script die like you did.,0
6986,"instead i would just return a http header in order to (at least) save some bandwidth on that ip, like:",0
6987,and returns something like this to your visitor (using chromium):,0
6988,"a cleaner and more professional approach to block ip addresses is not possible on many shared hosts, but should be mentioned here anyways, because it saves bandwidth, memory and cpu-cycles and can be described as dynamic creation of firewall rules .",0
6991,your php application could just write to a log file and fail2ban would disallow any connection attempt from that ip address to your server.,0
6992,root servers ain't expensive nowadays if you would like to try it.,0
6994,"if you didn't, someone could store a malicious &lt;iframe&gt; , or &lt;script&gt; in your code.",0
6995,"now, you don't necessarily need to protect the output.",0
6997,doing it this way allows you to purposefully store non-sanitized data for maybe styling purposes which would be ready for output.,0
6998,"as far as your example is concerned, it is correct.",0
7000,also note that a context may require different types of encodings.,0
7001,"for example, if you want to print a javascript value embedded into &lt;script&gt; , you have to obey both javascript and html syntax rules.",0
7002,i know there is already an answer to this but it may be worth noting that var_dump outputs boolean values better it just has worse formatting imo.,0
7003,you need to concatenate the phone number to the message in order for it to be sent.,0
7005,probably not the best answer but have you considered using var_dump instead of print_r?,0
7006,var_dump only goes down a couple of nesting levels so the issues with circular references that edmondscommerce mentioned would not cause your memory to become exhausted.,0
7007,"when this form is submitted, $_post['firstname'] and $_post['lastname'] will be arrays, so you can loop through them and insert them into the new table.",0
7008,"note that you should use a class rather than id for the shuffle_results div, because you're adding one for each row in the results.",0
7009,"unless you have hundreds of keywords in your page, performance should not being impacted.",0
7010,"but you sould better re-write the source files, instead of making the replacement at each request.",0
7011,"the double output is obvious because for each of your resultset from the query, you are running a for loop the number of times equal to the number of responses by the user.",0
7012,"a solution might be that inside the while loop, you can use in_array() to check if $row['answer'] exists in $_get['answer'].",0
7013,and accordingly decide if to check or uncheck the check-boxes.,0
7014,"the problem is that the value isn't being passed in querystring, and therfore $_get doesn't recognize it.",0
7015,as there is no element bearing that value and nothing inside that conditional statement will execute.,0
7016,"therefore, you need to change it to the following by adding value=""add to records"" :",0
7017,"do note that if you change it to value=""add to records"" with lowercase ""to"" and ""records"", the conditional statement will fail.",0
7019,"therefore, you need to make them match in array names.",0
7023,"you want to use array_map() here and concatenate both corresponding values from both arrays together creating a new array, e.g.",0
7024,of course if you just want to output it you can use echo inside array_map() .,0
7025,"and if you have an unknown amount of arrays you want to merge by concatenation you can do it with call_user_func_array() , e.g.",0
7026,here's a good tutorial for pdo in php if you want more.,0
7027,php doesn't decode that data and map it to the $_post super global automatically.,0
7028,"if you want php to do that, you need to send the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded (ie similar to the uri of a get request: key=value&amp;key2=value2 ).",0
7030,you can find that in the php://input stream.,0
7031,just use file_get_contents to read it:,0
7033,you should also use a prepared statement and password_hash() .,0
7034,"your present code isn't really all that safe to use, if you're going live or are live with this.",0
7037,"use a site-wide string just to alter the standard hash like md5(""mysitesalt!!""",0
7040,"if the enctype=""multipart/form-data"" is added to the form this will stop working for file type fields.",0
7041,but it doesn't have anything to do with you errors.,0
7043,the second error is about the variable scope .,0
7044,"your connection handler, here it is $mysqli is undefined inside the function userdata , because it tries to find a local variable $mysqli and fails.",0
7045,"you have to either pass the handler inside the function as a parameter, or restructure your code in a way, that you can get the handler from the other place.",0
7046,"first of all, please specify in the question which line is 116, it would be much easier to answer if we can see the exact operator.",0
7049,replace those calls to the mysql_ functions with the appropriate pdo functions.,0
7052,"or, for a query equivalent to the original query ( with the dot character as part of the column name), like this:",0
7053,"(that's not invalid, to include a dot character in a column name, but it is an unusual pattern, one that we don't see very often.",0
7054,i think that's because that pattern leads to more potential problems than whatever problem it was intended to solve.),0
7055,"if the query works the way it is in your code, then that dot character must be part of the column name.",0
7057,you should take a look at those.,0
7058,"if your field is an integer, consider using an int cast (int) before appending the value to the query.",0
7060,you can get the current page's url using php's $_server method.,0
7061,here is a tutorial - php: how to get the current page url,0
7063,"then you may include this url data in the login form either as a hidden field, or as a part of the action's target php file (like &lt;form method=""post"" action=""target.php?targeturl=someurl.com/somepage"" ) where the form's target script file can read this url.",0
7064,"then after processing login data, the processing script can redirect browser to the target url.",0
7065,print_r() will automatically print to the screen.,0
7066,you need to set the second parameter to true to actually capture it in a variable.,0
7067,you should change $_post['add to list'] to $_get['add to list'] since a click in a link generates a get request.,0
7068,"with ?add to list you are creating a variable, and you should not create variable names with spaces you are not passing an id as a parameter or any way of identifying the specific row, so if the user clicks the link, the variable will be set and for all the elements on the loop will be an insertion in the andrew table.",0
7069,you should receive the id and make a new query to the db,0
7070,"but as have been said, you will try to look soon for a replacement for mysql_* functions",0
7071,you query to insert element in your table is not properly built.,0
7072,"your values are in a php array which is not interpreted properly between your double quotes, it should be something like this:",0
7075,"well, first i don't see anything assigning anything to the session values, but the issue with your code is in this pattern: '$_session[itemorder][1]' .",0
7076,"first, i would make sure that mysql is expecting a varchar there and not an int.",0
7080,"i do feel obliged to point out that that system does not seem scaleable, and column names like agree_pppg_02 are not descriptive.",0
7081,you may want to go to the codereview stackexchange site to see if they can't offer tips on database design.,0
7082,"if you want to check if the session is started, you can use",0
7083,the problem is that the session als also there if the user isn't logged in.,0
7084,you have to check if e.g.,0
7085,you have a small glitch in your code.,0
7086,"it should be $bccfiled.="","" .$email; , note the .",0
7089,so the lower part of your script should go something like this:,0
7090,"note that i have not tested this, just typed it down.",0
7091,but you should get the idea when you study it.,0
7092,"to compliment marc b's answer and the usage of a ternary operator , you can use sessions to pass on that ( hidden ) value to another page and any subsequent page when using sessions.",0
7095,"you were pretty close, but some syntax issues and some addition of inputs (you didn't have any in the form) that you tried to use as data for your php submission didn't exist.",0
7096,"there was no form submission, but the button act the same as a submit and we were not stopping their default action.",0
7097,no field with the name post_id eists in your form.,0
7098,you are however passing the id manually through the url in your form action.,0
7099,"to get the id, you would use $_get['id'] rather than $_post['post_id']",0
7100,you have a few options as to how to extract data from the uri.,0
7101,every segment after box/ in the uri will be passed as an argument to the box method as levye suggested .,0
7102,use the url class to get the information you need.,0
7103,you should be ok with method 1. once you get into remapping and rewriting urls then method 2 will sometimes be your salvation.,0
7104,put die(var_dump($this-&gt;uri-&gt;segment_array())); as the first line in your controller and then access http://localhost/mediabox/home/box/this_is_argument_1/this_is_2/4/500/six/ from your browser.,0
7105,"$this-&gt;uri-&gt;segment(3); will hold the string this_is_argument_1 , $this-&gt;uri-&gt;segment(5) == 4; etc.",0
7106,keep in mind that segment 1 is the name of the controller and 2 is the name of the method being called.,0
7107,also note that the url class is initialized automatically by codeigniter so there is no need to load it manually (nor do you need to explode() or anything like that).,0
7109,"whereas end just returns the last element, this is equivalent to a ""peek"" command.",0
7110,if you want the array to shrink use array_pop if instead you want to retain the original array use end,0
7111,if you read the documentation for pdostatement::rowcount you will see this line,0
7115,have a look at mysqli ( http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php ) or pdo ( http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php ) and parameter binding.,0
7116,yeah instead of using global you could very well save it in a $_session variable as this is a super-global array and it can be accessed under functions or nested functions too.,0
7117,"first of all, i don't see the mysql_query() - the function to execute the query.",0
7118,"also, have you defined the $v_id before using it in the query?",0
7119,"similar to saying $var += 2, or $var = $var + 2. in this case, it's $showplayer = $showplayer | isset....",0
7120,there is no such function called filter_val .what you are looking for is filter_var(),0
7121,"in order to solve it, specifically for symfony2/travis, i had to do var_dump($client-&gt;getresponse()-&gt;getcontent()); in the test and let travis rerun to determine exactly what the test was seeing.",0
7122,"it looks like symfony2 was running in dev mode by default (to be expected) and was showing a few warnings that were suppressed in production mode, which was running locally.",0
7123,you first have to implement the user login part.,0
7124,"and after that, get the specified user id or login credentials and use that in your query.",0
7125,"it looks like you just need to explode again on the colons, so perhaps something like this ?",0
7126,"if mysql in your mamp is running in non-socket mode, you can try replacing the host value with 127.0.0.1 which connects via tcp on via port to the local machine--you'll need to figure out which port it's running on if it's not the default port.",0
7127,"you can see if it's starting in socket mode, and what file it's using if it has a config param like:",0

7136,"you probably want to use some unicode character encoding, for example utf-8 , and htmlspecialchars.",0
7137,"because there isn't any need to generate ""html entities"" for ""all [the] applicable characters"" (that is what htmlentities does according to the documentation) if it's already in your character set.",0
7138,"sometimes you're writing xml data, and you can't use html entities in a xml file.",0
7139,because htmlentities substitutes more characters than htmlspecialchars .,0
7141,htmlentities is only necessary if your pages use encodings such as ascii or latin-1 instead of utf-8 and you're handling data with an encoding different from the page's.,0
7143,this leaves your string more human-readable than it would be if you used htmlentities () to encode absolutely everything that has an encoding.,0
7145,"the second one is shorter, and does not cause any problems if iso-8859-1 charset is set.",0
7146,"when the data will be processed not only through a browser (to avoid decoding html entities), if the output is xml (see the answer by artefacto ).",0
7147,"you should use htmlspecialchars($strtext, ent_quotes) when you just want your string to be xml and html safe:",0
7148,"however, if you also have additional characters that are unicode or uncommon symbols in your text then you should use htmlentities() to ensure they show up properly in your html page.",0
7150,&amp;#039; is safer to use then &amp;apos; since older versions of internet&nbsp;explorer do not support the &amp;apos; entity.,0
7151,"technically, &gt; does not need to be encoded as per the xml specification, but it is usually encoded too for consistency with the requirement of &lt; being encoded.",0
7152,you can check the following code for more information about what's htmlentities and htmlspecialchars:,0
7153,"you need to pass it a little differently, like this:",0
7154,in your php don't use $_post['forminfo'] but rather $_post['nameoftheinput'] .,0
7156,"this prevents sql injection attacks, which i suggest you read more about :)",0

7161,you can see this in this line ( $startedcleanly indicates the return value of session_start() ): if (!$startedcleanly || zend_session_exception::$sessionstarterror != null) {,0
7162,you can use the attribute onclick=?,0
7163,in your button tag in combination with your js function: onclick=removetag(this) .,0

7167,"then, simply assign the values for your cart to session variables like so:",0
7169,"of course, you'll have to create the function scrub to scrub your input, but that's outside the scope of the question.",0

7177,"without seeing any more code, i'd guess that your redirect when there is no $_session['auth'] is happening when you're trying to access the register page.",0
7179,if you also need the array keys look at the function of array_keys.you will get an array of every key.,0
7180,you will be able to figure out if the sql query is getting created correctly.,0
7182,"since deletepatient() is not firing, the issue must be earlier in the source.",0
7183,"since the query is not the source of the issue, remove the debug statements:",0

7191,"that generally means parsing it with a dom parser, and then removing all elements and attributes that do not appear on a whitelist as safe (some attributes may be special cased to be filtered rather than stripped), and then converting the dom back to html.",0
7192,tools like html purifier exist to do this.,0
7193,then you have the third case and need to filter the html.,0
7196,however it is worth thinking about using striptags to remove script tags in order to combat xss.,0
7198,it might also be worth you taking a look at tinymce and see how they deal with such things,0
7200,"you can run this in your code, or create a method in your db class to check this and return true or false.",0
7201,"(or i guess you could modify the constructor to throw an exception, but i don't think that's the right way to go)",0
7202,"this way, when you'll write your unit test for the database class, it will be easy to inject a mock object",0
7203,you should use mysqli if you cannot then dont mix them.,0

7206,"if your code has still issue, you can try this:",0
7208,in your case you decided to go for a mysql a database.,0
7209,that is the most common choice that goes along with php!,0
7211,this extension is deprecated already and will be removed within the next versions of php!,0
7212,its preferible to go with mysqli_* functions instead or to use one of the two object oriented alternatives available mysqli and pdo,0
7213,"ok, now let's head onto the add friendship example!",0
7214,"conceptually you need three pages only to accomplish your task, i wont go into detail too much because in the end the code is simple to write... but you need to understand sessions/get variables and how they are different, and still able to interact each other!",0
7215,"other_profile.php this pages grabs the information of the people from the database, and addresses the ""add friend"" button or link",0
7216,as you can see global doesn't mean that you can pass the variable through different users at all!,0
7217,"every user belongs to its own session within its own pages and the only way cross information, is to use some sort of database!",0
7218,it can be a file a dbms or whatever!,0
7220,"remember : you have to call session_start on each page the session needs to be transported, furthermore session_start has to be called before anything is sent to the browser, so its best to place it at the very beginning of your page!",0
7221,try to place isset in your php to make sure they get all the values (works like required field) also i think the problem is in your querying,0
7222,"also, are you trying to print_r($_post['message']) in the page you're redirecting to from javascript?",0
7223,even your submit input is sent (as it is part of the form ).,0
7224,"and even without receiving anything, $_post will return an empty set array, so neither isset is a good option to check post fail or success.",0
7225,"you need to evaluate a specific field, like $_post['text'] , for emptiness instead.",0
7227,"you need to get your buttons to submit to a link, and then have the php unset the content.",0
7230,"you will want to have further validation that checks if post delete within the bounds of $_session['citydata'], but the basic idea is there.",0
7231,"you are using db class as an abstract class, you should create an object of it.",0
7232,"and you should also pass $dsn, $user, $password.",0
7233,if $row['id'] is array of id then you have to make these changechange name close in this function to carry array of id as close[],0
7234,"you cannot mix javascript and php like this, and $row does not - or shouldn't - actually exist in this context due to it not being within the foreach statement or - if this is a seperate js file - you have no corresponding context.",0
7235,"to achieve what you need, i'd suggest using ajax and setting a get request to a file which then returns an array which you can then use in your javascript.",0
7236,"note, $row should be used like this: $row['columnname'] (not just for readability).",0
7237,output is now the array of all your results and can be used.,0
7239,a common way to avoid outputting anything is to start an output buffer.,0
7240,at the top of b.php put:,0
7241,"edit: you have some errors in your you should add exit(); after your header(); also, $_session['user'] is just a variable, change it to isset($_session['user']) because i think that is what you want to do",0
7242,you could just make the whole thing in one file.,0
7243,"this is crude and totally incomplete, but something like this -",0
7244,"but as you asked, this is all on one page and that's the basic idea.",0
7246,it will re-submit the form with an added order parameter.,0
7247,this example does not consider pagination and makes the assumption that you have a sanitize function that cleans the input.,0
7248,obviously you should be using mysqli or pdo as they will both offer solutions for this.,0
7249,do not rely on mysql_ functions like mysql_real_escape_string.,0
7250,all mysql_ is deprecated and should not be used anymore.,0
7253,"you mention ?session=2 is used, but in code you refer to $_get['session'] .",0
7254,the case of these two should match.,0
7256,so set a date in the future that the cookie isn't deleted.,0
7258,"so, we need to explode them when a new line (\n) appears.",0
7259,first thing you need to explode the string by _,0
7260,"so if you pass [1, 2, 3] to visitarray you will have 1_2_3 , 1_2 , 1 in the result array.",0
7264,so if the request was made to www.site.com/user/register?layout=red var_dump(parse_url($_server['request_uri'])) would give you something like this.,0
7265,"so in your case this doesn't help, the use of flag l|last is enough.",0
7267,you could try to use addslashes instead of mysql_real_escape_string before you add the image to db in addproduct and then when you query the db to do something like this:,0
7268,"i guess i'm late, but you can also limit the results of explode to 5 :",0
7269,in your code there is no quantity based on a particular product.,0
7270,the quantity is assigned to the session variable $_session['qty'] .,0
7271,if you want to store the cart items based on individual product based.,0
7273,"you could also try what you already have, but include exit; at the end like this and add !",0
7274,"otherwise, using if (isset , you're telling ""if it is set"" which it isn't.",0
7275,i think you want to get $_server[server_name] from php so you need to add &lt;?php echo when creating the url to get from.,0
7278,"""bbb"" (without opening the php tag)",0
7279,"this just extracts all unique_id values into an array like array('banana', 'apple', ...) .",0
7280,"then finally, this goes through the original arrays again to filter out all elements whose unique_key is not in the array we created in the previous step:",0
7281,well if you are testing it on a dev environment then you can simply ignore the cloudsql routing now.,0
7282,i believe you need to do the following verify you can connect with simple mysql connect function and then make sure mysqli is installed (since on the web installation steps of google app engine that was not included),0
7284,then you may need to re-run the configuration to enable mysqli &amp; pdo drivers,0
7285,the action attribute will default to the current url.,0
7286,"it is the most reliable and easiest way to say ""submit the form to the same place it came from"".",0
7287,"there is no reason to use $_server['php_self'] , and # doesn't submit the form at all (unless there is a submit event handler attached that handles the submission).",0
7288,when using $_server['php_self'] it is very easy to inject malicious data by simply appending /&lt;script&gt;... after the whatever.php part of the url so you should not use this method and stop using any php tutorial that suggests it.,0
7290,"or if you're on a lower php version (&lt;5.3), a more common alternative is to use dirname(__file__) both returns the folder name of the file in context.",0
7291,the value of $_server['php_self'] is taken directly from the url entered in the browser.,0
7292,"therefore if you use it without htmlspecialchars() , you're allowing hackers to directly manipulate the output of your code.",0
7293,"for example, if i e-mail you a link to http://example.com/""&gt;&lt;script&gt;malicious_code_here()&lt;/script&gt;&lt;span class="" and you have &lt;form action=""&lt;?php echo $_server['php_self'] ?&gt;""&gt; , the output will be:",0
7294,"however, if you used &lt;form action=""&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($_server['php_self']) ?&gt;""&gt; , the output would be:",0
7295,"when you submitted the form, you'd have a weird url, but at least my evil script did not run.",0
7296,"on the other hand, if you used &lt;form action=""""&gt; , then the output would be the same no matter what i added to my link.",0
7302,"you can also explode your string using a regular expression, depending on what you really want for data.",0
7303,"if you want extract numbers like ""9.860"", ""9.750"" and ""10.250"" like this:",0
7305,the problem is that you're using a mysqli resource in a mysql function (note the missing i ).,0
7308,so just change that function to mysqli_insert_id($dbc);,0
7309,your are using binary or | instead of the boolean or || in your if clause.,0
7310,"instead of manually localizing the variables, you might as well extract($_request); - this is probably bad advise, since you might not understand the security implications of your script running entirely in the global scope.",0
7311,so the (better) alternative would be to manually foreach ($_request as $key=&gt;$value) and thus fill up your $_session.,0
7312,do so likewise in the second script.,0
7313,remember: foreach loops are our friends .,0
7314,"likewise the html output can be accomplished in a loop, reducing the overall code size.",0
7315,"you might be missing a session_start, or also likely: have premature output and got a notice which you didn't tell us about.",0
7317,"in the second page ""error page"", you placed session_start but after you tried to read the $_session var, so place it in the top of that ""error page"" instead of the middle.",0
7318,this value tells php which session id to look up for you.,0
7319,"without it, calling session_start() will generate a new session, which appears to be what is happening in your case.",0
7321,you can hash current password with user's salt then check if they are equal.,0
7323,and for echoing your errors you can have a paragraph with error id,0
7324,"this has nothing to do with bootstrap, which is just css + a bit of js.",0
7325,forms are meant to format http requests based on user input values - in this case you just need a link:,0
7326,"if you want to fancy style it in bootstrap, add something like:",0
7327,but also you need to sanitize the data first so...try this,0
7330,"if you used the function somefunction($conn) , that would make your code much messier, since you wouldn't actually have universal access to $conn from anywhere.",0
7331,you should go with solution b imo.,0
7334,solution b: database::$conn should be public if you want to be able to access it by database::$conn from anywhere.,0
7335,"if it's private, then you would always need to call database::getobject();",0
7336,in your code you would simply iterate through your post array and concatenate the values creating a new variable with a string containing the values i exampled before.,0
7337,i'll call such variable $my_selected_fruits just so i can use it in the sql query i'll example below.,0
7338,"to get them from the database later will only need $fruits = explode("","", $db_array) where $db_array will be apples,bananas,oranges (or whatever there is stored in the database) and this will output:",0
7339,"i don't know exactly why you are trying to do this, but since you insist, i now find it better to just create a json object and save it on the database.",0
7341,"so using json_encode() you would create a json object like the following one and save it in the database (it's an example, depending on your array, it will be encoded differently, you don't need to worry about this json):",0
7343,"$message , a string, is where an array of matches is supposed to go.",0
7344,explanation: if the cookie is set already => !isset($_cookie['domain_newvisitor']) and user is not admin you are setting cookie.,0
7345,then the cookie will exits every time.,0
7346,as you are creating it if it is first time and checking if it exits.,0
7347,now you can use $cookievalue in js by passing it from server to client.,0
7348,"strip_tags is useless, because it is only relevant in an html context.",0
7349,any one of the other two methods would be sufficient to prevent sql injection.,0
7350,"generally, just use the appropriate escaping mechanism for the language you're dealing with.",0
7351,"in this case you're dealing with sql, so mysql_real_escape_string alone is fine.",0
7359,"i am sorry, but your code is bad (a little bit).",0
7360,very bad to read and understand what your code is doing.,0
7361,you need split code by logical parts.,0
7363,for mysql to best use pdo.,0
7364,front part need contain only html .,0
7366,"or, all of this you can do with some frameworks, instead writing all by himself.",0
7367,then access the folder from the root directory.,0
7368,"for example: href=""http://&lt;?php echo $_server['http_host'] ?&gt;/demo/assets/css/style.css"" href=""http://&lt;?php echo $_server['http_host'] ?&gt;/demo/contents/test.php""",0
7371,"if you want to see what comes from the function, try debugging with:",0
7372,in your example it looked like you were trying to unset the value instead of unsetting the key of the value.,0
7373,for the exact example you have shown this should work:,0
7377,"you can encode array_values($a) instead, which will return a reindexed array.",0
7378,in addition to the array_values technique it is possible to use array_splice and remove an element and re-index in one step:,0
7383,"if you wish to display a single product, and a list all others that are not that product, you should use two separate queries, one that specifies the product and another that excludes it from your list of ""other products"".",0
7384,"alternatively, you can display all products, but mark the selected product during your loop -- you can save this product to a second variable for use later in the page as well.",0
7385,"if i understood you correctly, you just want to return the row from the database into a session, so you can use it later to construct html elements:",0
7387,"if you insert $_post[""location""] = ""'' -- "" into @frank provost's code, then you will update all the rows instead of the one with the fbid session key.",0
7388,"if you have multi query enabled then you can insert $_post[""location""] = ""''; drop table users -- "" into @frank provost's code, then you will drop the table users .",0
7389,you can take a look at my pdo implementation example on github: https://github.com/maartensch/database-pdo-mysql-class-php,0
7390,when you create a new object via $database = new mysqldatabase(); the method _construct() isn't invoked and therefore neither is $this->open_connection() and therefore no value is assigned to the property $connection which remains null and no connection to the mysql server is established .,0
7392,"fix the typo in _construct() pass $this->connection to mysql_real_escape_string(), mysql_query() and mysql_error() make sure open_connection() has all the parameters it needs, e.g.",0
7393,"isset($db_server,$db_user,$db_pass,$db_name) or die('missing parameters'); add some debug output to see whether it has been called at all, e.g.",0
7394,"echo ""debug: this-&gt;connection = mysql_connect($db_server,$db_user,$db_pass);\n""; don't roll your own mysql class, use one of the gazillion existing classes, preferably one with broader acceptance.",0
7396,"while using these functions, a user may encounter an error - notice: undefined index.",0
7397,this error can be avoided with the help of php isset ().,0
7398,"this error will be notified, but that depends on the configuration of the server.",0
7399,notice: undefined index is a minor error and hence not notified by default.,0
7400,"with the help of the error_reporting function, the type of error reported can be changed.",0
7401,you should also consider using php pdo.,0
7404,"this is caused when you've not set your form method attribute value to post so set that to post , using no method attribute will set it to get instead and your block of code will be ignored as you are using if(isset($_post['login']) {} so as no login isset , the code inside your if condition will be skipped.",0
7405,"also, there are many many issues in your code, you are calling your query twice which is not required, not sanitizing your inputs, using mysqli_real_escape_string() is not enough consider learning a bit more about the basics and than get started with your project.",0
7407,mysql_connect() and mysqli_connect() use two different default ports from the php.ini file.,0
7408,"i wouldn't guess that these would be different than the standard default 3306, but worth a check or try adding the path to the host url.",0
7410,you'd want to use mysqli_connect_errno() .,0
7411,below is the example from php.net.,0
7413,"cookies are strings that are sent by the server to the browser, and that the browser must send back to the server on every subsequent request, until the cookie expires.",0
7414,"for example, if the server responds with a request with the header set-cookie: foo=abc123; expires=wed, 09 jun 2021 10:18:14 gmt , on every subsequent request until 9 june 2012 the browser must send the request header cookie: foo=abc123 .",0
7415,"on the php script, $_cookie['foo'] will be abc123 .",0
7416,"php sessions are based on cookies, but they don't store the values inside a cookie.",0
7417,"if you store $_session['foo'] = 'abc123' , the server will not send foo=abc123 to the client as cookie, but will rather create a session stored on the server and will send as cookie only the id of the session.",0
7419,it will then send (automatically) a cookie to the client similar to phpsessid=php_session_id_here .,0
7420,"all of this is done automatically by php, and you don't need to worry about that.",0
7421,"at the end of this story, yes, your code is safe.",0
7422,"that is because you're not setting a cookie authenticated=pass (which will be insecure, as clients can easily overwrite cookies), but you're instead storing that value in the php session storage and the client sees only the session id.",0
7423,"ps: instead of just storing a boolean 'authenticated', you may want to store more useful information in the session, like the user id of the authenticated user in the database or anything else that can be meaningful.",0
7424,"ps2: php sessions have legacy support for browsers that do not have cookies enabled, but in 2015 that's meaningless (i wonder who still disables cookies!",0
7425,"- if you do that, 90% of the websites will stop working).",0
7426,"as a consequence, you should ensure that you have these two ini settings: (docs: http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-cookies )",0
7427,sqlite_open was the function in the sqlite2 extension.,0
7428,"what you've installed is probably the sqlite3 module, which requires sqlite3::open() instead.",0
7429,but you should not use the native interface either way.,0
7431,so first of all you loop over wrong array.,0
7432,"array you looking for is under statuses index, so change your loop into:",0
7436,now $query is an array containing the separated values.,0
7438,"from what i can see, your script doesn't handle data from $_post['remark'] .",0
7439,you are only handling the $_post['present'] part of your post.,0
7441,"based off your code, the ""remark"" is an array.",0
7442,brackets in name [ ] you would need something like:,0
7444,$value is the value associated with the key.,0
7445,"if you wanted to remove that value, you would unset the associated key:",0
7446,you can use array_multisort to order the array values by a second array of mt_rand values:,0
7447,here $order is an array of mt_rand values of the same length as $arr .,0
7448,array_multisort sorts the values of $order and orders the elements of $arr according to the order of the values of $order .,0
7451,if you want to access test value by $_post you have to use form like this :,0
7452,"it's not bad per se, but function calls in php are relatively slow, so if you avoid array_push throughout your code, you may notice the effect.",0
7454,even the documentation of array_push mentions this alternative as a faster one:,0
7456,it sounds as if magic_quotes_gpc is enabled in php (this is deprecated in later versions of php).,0
7457,in which case you'll need to call stripslashes() on the $_get value before processing it.,0
7459,"however, this is a lot to send via get, consider using a post request instead.",0
7460,try this code it's works for you.your code not working because of you have pass array in color so you need to implode your array and then paas to you mail.i have try this and it's works fine.,0
7461,"i would check the actual value of $_session['action'] , as well as separately echoing out (or var_dump) other variables such as $emp_name for testing / ensuring they are actually populated as you expect.as jay blanchard mentioned, using $_session['somevar'] is better than using the global keyword.",0
7462,"since you're calling the page directly, i'd probably setup a quick script to log the data to a file when the page is called.",0
7463,"of course, you want the code neat.",0
7464,"so you can make a wrapper function, like so:",0
7465,i think your problem is that you reload the page when you click on a button.,0
7466,"so, instead making the input type to submit , you instead use button .",0
7467,"also, use a hidden input to store your value when an user presses on approve or unapprove .",0
7468,"from there, you can bind the buttons to event handlers (we will use click()):",0
7469,now you don't need to reload the page (which saves server-bandwidth and loadtime).,0
7470,and restart your xampp once you have applied the settings.,0
7471,start by placing the value of the clientid in the button value.,0
7472,"then move the delete code up to the top of the script, and outside the loop.",0
7474,your error message is already telling you what goes wrong: there's simply no _name in $_post .,0
7475,"i guess that you meant to supply these things using a html &lt;form&gt; , so maybe you forgot to make fields for that?",0
7476,"anyway, you just rely on your user input, which is a security and stability hazard deluxe.",0
7478,you $sql is something that your php/sql tutorial should have told you never to do.,0
7479,"read this comic and then write a one-page essay about what you did wrong, please!",0
7480,you should have a method to check if a user is user_banned and a method to ban_user a user.,0
7481,cast the user_id as an array and you can do one loop.,0
7482,"rather lengthy for what seems to be such a simple task, and i'm thinking that the mysqli::multi_query is probably still the best way to go about this (after using mysqli::real_escape to add the needed security) but other than the bulkiness of this function, it works and it's safe (from what i can tell) while keeping the server request cost to a minimum.",0
7483,"alright well, thanks to user934258 i went back and re-examined the coding of this/these methods.",0
7484,by taking his advice i was able to cut about 25 lines of code from the banning method(s).,0
7486,"for those of you in the future who may find this topic helpful, here is the final product of my code.",0
7487,note that very little error checking/filtering/sanitizing is occurring in these methods.,0
7488,"i have a couple reasons for this: values of variables are checked in the script, i am the only one granted rights to do this, and the values for the vars like $user_id are pre-populated into checkboxes and drop-down lists with the exact values from the db so chances of a wrong $user_id is slim to none.",0
7489,"ps: i don't know if i understood correctly your question, but i hope.",0
7490,so why not do a fuzzy search?,0
7492,i'll assume you know what to do with the results.,0
7493,"quick update, if you are worried about users entering in last name first name middle, or what have you, you could always use the above but do a locate on the entire string:",0
7494,this will check both columns for any instances of any of the string.,0
7495,"you should probably (after sanitizing the string, as was rightly suggested already) also remove any commas (but not hyphens) in case someone enters last,first or what have you.",0
7496,replace them with spaces and then reduce all multi-spaces to one space to be double sure.,0
7497,the problem i see in your function is that you return immediately after you check !isset($_post[$p]) .,0
7498,i believe you want to continue on to the next item and operate on that accordingly.,0
7499,"also, you don't need to pass these by reference since you are not modifying any of the passed parameters.",0
7500,"so, you can work in this string using whichever string manipulation function you'd want, like the ones you talked about.",0
7502,"if you are working with an html document and want a ""full"" solution, using domdocument::loadhtml and working with dom manipulation methods might be another (a bit more complex, but probably more powerful) solution.",0
7504,"if you want to replace two strings, you can pass arrays to the two first parameters of str_replace .",0
7505,"if you want to replace all instances of ' &lt;a href="" ', well, it's what str_replace does by default :-)",0
7506,the addsponsor() function is calling var_dump on what it sees as null because the variables you are trying to access are in the global scope.,0
7507,this page explains it pretty well.,0
7509,i ran into that because of trying to capture a var_dump string in an output buffer for the json data to be dislpayed in an alert().,0
7510,"you'll be able to resolve it, but keep it in mind.",0
7511,an example of a successful ob html approach is in the comment here .,0
7512,"to take advantage of the insert speed of multiple inserts in mysql ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-speed.html ), you can use a prepared statement that builds the larger query.",0
7513,"this does add complexity over an more iterative approach, so is probably only worth it for high-demand systems or largish data sets.",0
7514,we're looking to generate a query that looks something like this:,0
7515,this is a general problem with most orms.,0
7516,they tend to use additional memory in order to improve performance.,0
7517,"unfortunately, you will occasionally find a time when they use too much memory.",0
7518,the solution is just don't use an orm when you run into these situations.,0
7519,switch to something lower level like pdo instead when you need to process a huge amount of data.,0
7520,that will only use a few kb of memory and execute extremely fast (as long as you have appropriate indexes in the database).,0
7521,"all we need to do now is add a condition to the ajax request page, in this case data.php, to exit if this isn't set, or if it isn't a request from our domain.",0
7522,"what you have is an array of objects, so you can't access id with brackets .",0
7524,"similarly, use array_pop() if the element is the last in the array.",0
7525,"ok so i finally managed to have something that is actually working, here is the code to have a sign up form that needs to be validated by an administrator if someone needs it in the future:",0
7526,"neither method is ""more correct""; both are just as valid, the one you choose completely depends on the ux you are trying to achieve.",0
7528,"if the form is on one page, and you're going to be submitting the data to another page via the action=""example.php"" attribute, the html for the form should (obviously) be on the first page, while everything else should be on the second ( example.php ) page (all the php and sql).",0
7529,"if there's a validation error, you can use header(location: firstpage.php?error=something) to return users to the original page to fix their mistake.",0
7530,"if you're doing everything on one page (by putting action=""&lt;?php echo $_server[""php_self""]; ?&gt;"" or simply action="""" , both of which do the exact same thing), you should do the validation when a user submits the form on that one page, and if there are no validation errors, insert the data into the database and redirect the user using php's header() function.",0
7532,"name=""medid"" => $_post['medid'] name=""medid[]"" => $_post['medid'][0] de last [0] will get you the first element of the array",0
7535,bacause its unknown how many phone numbers someone have its easier to just retrieve one variable as an array and iterate over this array after.,0
7536,"in your code you have name=""medid[]"" and $_post['medid'] .",0
7537,so your form is sending an array but you retrive a normal variable.,0
7538,few things to say; first i don't understand the concept of using a query string for action when you are using post as a method for submitting the values.,0
7539,secondly if you are trying to consume the values from the query string as well; then i can't find the $_get[] in your entire program.,0
7541,"also, the name=""medid[]"" won't create any array for php.",0
7543,put that table into a form with method=post and when submitting you'll find all input 's in the $_post array by name.,0
7545,the array is now full of 10 copies of $something .,0
7546,that happens to be 10 pointers to our closure .,0
7547,there's no reason for php to think that that's not what you want.,0
7549,"for an object, it will try to call __tostring() (or the equivalent ""under the hood"" for built-in objects), but closure has no such method.",0
7550,this is where your error is coming from.,0
7553,in the if statements where you have $_post[...] = 'some value' you need to use == to compare the values instead of = which sets the value of the variable.,0
7554,"if your php application uses connection pooling to the database, and the database caches prepared statements, then yes, the caching will persist between pages.",0
7558,you should be aware that mysql connection setup and teardown is actually very fast and many php installations do not use connection pooling because of this.,0
7559,"either way, you should also invest time in your server settings, particularly the wait_timeout parameter.",0
7561,most php code and libraries assume this is the case.,0
7563,"when a request is served php ""cleans"" the instance and frees resources and other variables.",0
7564,this is done in several steps.,0
7565,since fastcgi keeps the process alive after a request not all steps are executed and not all memory is freed.,0
7566,"eg(persistent_list) which is used by mysql_pconnect() , pg_pconnect() , ... this list isn't emptied between requests as long as the process keeps alive (could be, depending on the actual implementation, but that would defy the purpose of eg(persistent_list)).",0
7567,"if you use persistent connections your script might get a ""re-used"" connection established during a previous request.",0
7568,to (re-)use a prepared statement directly you need the identifier for that statement (and that connection).,0
7569,"when using (php-)postgresql this is simply a (connection-wise) unique string you pass to pg_execute() , so your script has no problem to gain access to the statement previously prepared by another instance (using the same connection).",0
7570,using mysqli or pdo-mysql you need a resource/object as statement identifier.,0
7571,that's kind of a problem since neither the mysqli nor the pdo extension seem to offer a way of storing the resource in eg(persist_list) between requests and you can't recreate it either.,0
7573,all you can hope for is mysql's server-side query cache .,0
7574,in recent versions (see link) it may recognize the statement when using prepared statements.,0
7575,but even then it doesn't re-use the actual prepared statement:,0
7577,prepared statements are for a single page load.,0
7579,"you are trying to unset the variable named after the key (which makes no effect as such variable does not exist), not array element as you wanted.",0
7581,your are echoing fields that you did not declare... try adding extract($_post); to the begining of your code,0
7585,first of all look at your browser debugger of what is really sent to the php file.,0
7586,second thing: you will send json to it.,0
7587,"that means, that you have an post form array like this:",0
7588,i then select the post by the id which i $_get from the uri and display some form -specific elements that hold the post values.,0
7589,then i update the data in the db.,0
7590,"replace ""userid"" with the columnname of the id in your table.",0
7591,it's a operator precedence issue as .,0
7592,"therefore you append 2 to ""sum is "" and then increment the string by 8 which results in this odd behavior.",0
7593,"requesting a parameter with cleanstr() is not a good idea, it's better to use",0
7594,as $val_1 will be an integer after that line.,0
7595,this might be important for later development e.g.,0
7596,"indent correctly, reading your code is hurting my eyes",0
7597,this way your form has it's own unique send value rather than the bog standard submit which could lead to future issues if and when you decide to add anymore forms into the website.,0
7599,accordingly changing the value of $element will not change the array too.,0
7600,it's not clear from your question why you would need to instantiate a pdostatement directly.,0
7601,i think you need to rethink your goals.,0
7602,"moreover, you are making a gibberish out of almost natural english of sql.",0
7603,not to mention that this function is prone to sql injection.,0
7604,"so, you just have to get rid of it.",0
7606,"there is a lot going on here, so i will try to answer specific questions and address some issues.",0
7607,note that just because code has objects doesn't mean that it is object oriented.,0
7608,"you can use pdo in a purely procedural style, and the presence of -&gt; does not make it oop.",0
7609,i wouldn't be scared of using pdo for this reason.,0
7611,"consider $pdo-&gt;prepare(""select * from t1 where col1 = $_post[rightfromuser]"") .",0
7612,"this is a prepared statement, but it is still vulnerable to injection.",0
7614,if the statement is properly parameterized (e.g.,0
7615,"instead of $_post ), you would know longer be vulnerable.",0
7616,actually is vulnerable because it has variables in it that can be injected.,0
7617,"although the query is vulnerable, it doesn't necessarily mean that the code is.",0
7618,perhaps you have a whitelist on the table and column names and they are checked before the function is called.,0
7621,"looking at the count of fetched results, using select count or looking at the table stats (for some engines) are surefire way to get the column count for select statements.",0
7622,note that pdostatement::rowcount does work for select with mysql .,0
7625,i would advise against this because you have to know about this functionality when using the function.,0
7626,"it can be convenient at times, but i think it would be easier to handle the result of the function transparently.",0
7627,"that is to say, you should not have to inspect the return value to discover its type and figure out how to handle it.",0
7629,these errors should be very rare in production unless something legitimately happens to the server.,0
7631,"during development, you probably want the exceptions to be as loud as possible so you can figure out exactly what to debug.",0
7632,"i doubt you will have to use this, so don't worry too much about it.",0
7633,essentially it allows you to fetch from separate prepared statements in parallel.,0
7634,"i could be wrong, but i don't think you need to do this for mysql (i.e.",0
7635,you could call execute on both statements without calling closecursor .,0
7636,pdo's documentation on this (above) seems to be more forgiving about it than it is about rowcount and select .,0
7637,"i would use it with confidence for mysql, but you can always just select last_insert_id() .",0
7638,this is a difficult question to answer because there are so many possible definitions of right .,0
7639,"apparently your code is working and you are using pdo, so in a way you are.",0
7641,instead you should pass the database as an argument to the function.,0
7643,in general you should avoid global state since it makes code harder to reuse and harder to test.,0
7645,i don't really see why you would want to select all columns for a table for a given id.,0
7646,this is not as useful as it seems.,0
7648,"firstly, make sure your markup is valid.",0
7649,note that you have some spaces where there should not be spaces (e.g.,0
7650,"at a minimum you should have a blank html document, with your contents inside a &lt;body&gt; tag:",0
7652,"going back to the code in your question...if all of your code is in the same script, it will say ""not sent"" on page load, because nothing has been posted at that point .",0
7653,"it will only output ""sent"" once you've filled in the name field and pressed the submit button.",0
7654,"you were wondering why this ""works"" with the get method.",0
7656,on page load you run index.php .,0
7657,"after submitting the form, the url would be manipulated (e.g.",0
7658,"so on page load it says ""not sent"" but then once it has ?name=andy in the url it will say ""sent"" because that's a get parameter.",0
7659,you can store your data in the $_session variable.,0
7662,you might want to use a more appropriate variable name instead.,0
7664,it's way less circuitous with parameter binding.,0
7665,"alright, first of all, your code you're using there is vulnerable.",0
7668,"you can solve this in any way you like, here's my very simplistic example.",0
7669,"i made this database assuming you will always have a same path to your uploads, if not then you will have to go with a different solution.",0
7671,"x5wa88bq), since that file exists it points it to the correct directory.",0
7672,the code that handles the video realises that load.php?v=$name points to a video (or not) and plays it (doesn't).,0
7673,"now if you want to do more 'styling', you can check out .htaccess guides .",0
7674,it will help you out with rewriting your url's.,0
7675,and hopefully then you could do,0
7676,"you should use array type naming loc_chks[], this also lets you use specific keys for each item, for example: loc_chks[sales] and with php you have it in $_post[""loc_chks""][""sales""] html (myform.html):",0
7678,php has perfectly adequate ways to deal with cookies and sessions.,0
7681,"for example, cookies have extra things that you have to worry about, like domain names and expiration times, while sessions won't.",0
7683,"if you want to wrap them, wrap them, but don't wedge them into an interface designed for another purpose.",0
7684,"session_id() returns an empty string when the session has not yet been started, at least at the interactive prompt.",0
7685,you can use this to detect if you need to start a session.,0
7686,cookies are limited in number and size per domain.,0
7687,"for example in ie , each cookie is limited to 4kb and a there can be a maximum of 20 cookies per domain.",0
7688,cookies get sent to the server with every request.,0
7689,if you are storing 80kb of data in cookies that will make every request (including requests that are for non-dynamic resources on the same host) quite large.,0
7690,caching data in the $_session is much more reasonable since the only increase in back-and-forth traffic is the single small session-id cookie header.,0
7691,the big downside with caching in the $_session array is that the session-data is separate for each client.,0
7692,"with your other caching back-ends (apc, memcache, etc), data is shared and available for requests from every client.",0
7693,"the issue this raises is that with per-client session caches, there is no easy way to clear or update a value from other clients' session-data, resulting in stale caches.",0
7694,"if you print_r your $_post['fan'] , you will see that this is array .",0
7696,"well, in order for the on button to checked, the $_session['r1'] must be equal to ""o"".",0
7697,have you checked the value of $_session['r1'] ?,0
7698,you need to decide if you're using mysqli in procedural style (like in the first line of this extract) or in object oriented style (like in the second line).,0
7699,"looking at the rest of your posted code, i'd imagine that changing the second line (your line 19) to if ($result = mysqli_query(""select * from users"")) will get rid of that error (though not necessarily any other errors).",0
7700,with a little trick and with .htaccess you can make this much easier.,0
7704,"and now i'll give you my php script correction, if you want to use it feel free on doing it:",0
7706,"in order to update, you need an update statment, dont forget to add a student_id on the form.",0
7707,consider this example: (same page process).,0
7708,"at a guess, the submit field has no name, so it won't be included in $_post .",0
7709,"your file upload will be placed in $_files , see handling file uploads .",0
7710,beyond the sql injection mentioned above by daverandom take a look at the php manual on how setcookie works:,0
7711,"it mentions specifically the info is injected into the headers, and therefor not available until your next page load.",0
7714,nobody enjoys a sql injection attack.,0
7716,"you can get the last insert id using mysql_insert_id , http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-insert-id.php .",0
7718,"this should give you what you need, it is not working because of your condition :",0
7719,and check for errors on php and mysql and that the session array does have a value and that the column is long enough to hold the data.,0
7721,which is what's going on here.,0
7722,your code puts on the brakes as soon as it hits starting the session and failed on you silently .,0
7724,"if you left it unchecked and looked for $_post['test'] it would error out, as it is not set.",0
7726,so maybe this happens too if you pass empty values.,0
7727,"in that case the connection could actually be established, and the result won't 'die'.",0
7728,best thing is to use var_dump to check what $dbc contains after the call and continue from there.,0
7731,first check your php versionecho 'current php version: ' .,0
7733,if not then inform to our server admministrator or if you have access then go to phpini file and enable mysqli (remove semicolon from it),0
7734,"what you want to do is reshape your naming of your select box, in html try making the select box value into an array:",0
7735,"then when you get the $_post data, you can run a foreach through the array of [select] which will be an array of 1 value:",0
7736,"this will give you access to the values, this is a little bit long winded but your question seems to be abridged, so i've worked a bit of a long way round.",0
7740,"most likely, you have to escape the backslash ""\"" into a double backslash ""\\"", both in $a and in (""\""... which becomes explode(""\\"", $a);",0
7741,even stackoverflow's syntax highlighting tells you there is an error :) (see your print_r in red?),0
7742,"\"" = a double quote, which by the way generates your syntax error as the string is not ""finished"" and the parser treats ,$a); and the rest as a continuation of the string...,",0
7744,"(it implies, as another user [@xdazz] said, that you could use single quotes strings '...' to avoid escaping).",0
7745,just have a look at the different pdo fetch modes.,0
7747,so you have to assign it to another variable.,0
7748,"the charset is called "" utf8 "" in mysql, not utf-8.",0
7749,"having set this charset parameter correctly, $stmt-&gt;fetchall(pdo::fetch_assoc) will already return utf-8 encoded data and there's no need to use utf8_encode at all.",0
7750,"even that wouldn't have helped though, since the callback for array_walk needs to modify the parameter by reference, which utf8_encode does not do.",0
7751,you probably meant to do this:,0
7752,you are using isset() function in a wrong place.,0
7753,you should check if $_get['page'] is set or not first.,0
7754,"$libraryuser-&gt;mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($_get[""page""]) returns """" when there is no $_get['page'] , which is then set as value for $getpage .",0
7755,"so your isset($getpage) is always true , which makes the main problem.",0
7758,"you never need to implode json objects, they are decoded perfectly find.",0
7759,make sure you know the difference between csv (comma separated values) and json.,0
7760,"if you're trying to get a json decoded array's values, use it like this:",0
7763,"if you need multiple connections open at once, you can simply create multiple instances of pdo:",0
7764,"you can make multiple calls to mysql_connect(), but if the parameters are the same you need to pass true for the '$new_link' (fourth) parameter, otherwise the same connection is reused.",0
7765,if you do not pass a link identifier then the last connection created is used (in this case the one represented by $dbh2) e.g.,0
7766,"retrieve all the rows from the table without any order by or limit clause, like this:",0
7767,"loop through the result set and append the rows to the $resultarray array, like this:",0
7770,i've seen that solution in several snippets but it has a bug which is related to the output of realpath() .,0
7771,"the realpath() function removes the trailing directory separator, so imagine two contiguous directories such as:",0
7772,"as realpath() would remove the last directory separator, your method would return ""good path"" if $_get['path'] was equal to ""../baz_baz"" as it would be something like",0
7774,and put yout php code at top before using it in html,0
7775,"ok to be honest with you , your code needs more and more sorting , its not secure , yes maybe its a code that you are testing something with , but first thing you should thing about is security .",0
7777,but i have fully edited your php code to a new one and added a table to my database and tested the code and its working perfect .you are going to see me using array inside the execute part and that's for the security porpoises .,0
7778,this is the code : i will link an image to the database structure that i used in the end of my answer,0
7779,"hope this answer help you , but again , you have a lot to learn and good luck .",0
7780,"let me know if the code did not work with you , cause its working perfect with me .",0
7782,even if you did have the value of their active filed in there ( you have select * ) you would still be checking string '1' against string 'yes',0
7784,"now if you are sure active will always be yes for them being active, the $user already contains this data, so why not use it like this, and save the query.",0
7785,one thing i feel compelled to mention is that you should look into prepared statements.,0
7789,"this is because with a prepared statement, the variables are entirely separate from the query commands and so the db knows not to execute anything in them.",0
7790,"even with escaping there could be edge cases that may be an issue, i don't know of any per-say, but something like using a hexadecimal version of a quote are things i have seen in examples, or weird character strings that the db would see as a quote.",0
7791,"look, i see several issues in your code.",0
7792,the first is the double query for the same data.,0
7793,you can simplify this whole thing to one query.,0
7795,so a -more- correct way to do it would be this one:,0
7796,"of course, the best alternative is to use a mysqli statement and use bind_param / execute .",0
7797,this example is only to follow your style of using mysqli.,0
7798,"it's returning you an object rather than an array, so you should try using object notation to access the properties:",0
7799,"this might have been clearer if you used var_dump instead of var_export , which displays code required to recreate the object, rather than a straight breakdown of the object itself.",0
7800,you'll also have to add the user and the user permissions on that database.,0
7801,"as we discussed in the comments, your code snippet shows that you are using both mysql and mysqli functions.",0
7804,"mysql_real_escape_string() requires an existing or previous mysql_connect() connection, see the error notes in the manual .",0
7805,it looks like you're using mysqli instead.,0
7806,consider also using something like pdo - mysql and mysqli extensions are both deprecated &amp; removed come php7 (see the deprecation notice at the top of the page).,0
7807,"if you want to add $row in $result , you can use array_merge() function like this:",0
7808,your call to database::lastinsertid() throws an undefined method error because you haven't defined a method database::lastinsertid() .,0
7809,you need to add the definition to your database class the same as you did with prepare() :,0
7810,implode() does the exact opposite of explode() .,0
7811,"basically, it glues the entire array back together with whatever string you want (a &lt;br&gt; in this case).",0
7812,so the only code you would need to display the postcodes in order would be:,0
7815,"there is nothing at all wrong with saving ""lots of data"" in the $_session .",0
7816,by doing this you are not at all increasing transfer size or anything so you're not affecting the client as $_session is purely server-side.,0
7817,"as above, this is a non-issue, you're not ""posting all the data in a form each page change"", it's stored server-side in a flat file that is simply deserialized automatically when you reopen the session, and put into $_session .",0
7818,"provided that $_session 's lifetime is enough for you, you should use it.",0
7819,"if you need something more persistent than a $_session , for example you need to store an object against a user for the whole time that they're logged in, you can consider either serializing objects in a database and pulling them out on pageload, or simply recreating an object from values you store against the user.",0
7821,"only small typo error is there, catch(pdoexception §e) have the wrong character '§' instead of '$'",0
7824,"what are they teaching in these ""schools""?!",0
7827,"the mysql protocol supports a special command com_ping for this purpose, and the c api has a call mysql_ping() to send it.",0
7828,this tests if the connection is active.,0
7830,"you can only submit sql query strings, not special commands.",0
7832,so the issue is moot anyway.,0
7833,"i don't know of any more elegant solution than trying to issue a ""dummy"" query like select 1 , catch the exception, and if you get error code 2006 (server has gone away), then reconnect.",0
7834,"you can create a singleton class to hold your db connection, and test for a live connection every time the application code calls getconnection().",0
7835,"you can see that it detects that the connection failed, and reinitializes.",0
7837,you are referencing your variables incorrectly.,0
7838,"on xyz.php you are setting $_session['myvar'] = $var1; and then on ljk.php you are trying to echo $_session['var1'] which wouldn't exist, as it has not been set.",0
7840,"you want to utilize $_session , not $_session .",0
7841,you are using $_request which is a superglobal and can raise some security concerns.,0
7842,"while your code may not be affected for its current purpose, its always a better idea to just avoid it.",0
7843,instead utilize $_post as that will only take the data that has been posted.,0
7845,(edit: @zerkms correctly points out that an explicit cast is better than intval() .,0
7847,you should also correct your php to avoid sql injections.,0
7849,as we can see $rows contains again array.,0
7850,so you cant not echo it.,0
7851,"instead you have to use print_r , to echo you have to iterate $row array.",0
7852,so after a lot of looking it seems i found the answer in the php manual,0
7855,2) install an older version of php (before php7) which supports the mysql extension,0
7856,"if what you claim is true... that mysql_ functions are working under php7, then the most likely explanation for that is that someone installed a third party module/library that exports mysql_ functions.",0
7857,"but you must do it over an encrypted connection (that is, one that uses tls).",0
7859,the problem is the way you use arrays in your form:,0
7860,"so when you send this information to the server, the index of the file is not related in any way to the index of the text fields.",0
7861,"edit: when you do it like that, you need to remove the loop in the loop as now you are overwriting your $key / $value variables of the outer loop in the inner loop.",0
7862,you only need one loop and you need to prepare your sql statement before the loop (you are not preparing it at all now).,0
7864,"(?i) - turning case sensitivity off ( unless you need to check for 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letters - then, remove the i flag and replace (?=.",0
7865,*[a-z]) ) ^ - start of string (?=.,0
7868,"{8,} - at least 8 characters $ - end of string.",0
7869,as you are using the post method in your action you should get the values accordingly,0
7870,for german words we need to use iso-8859 encoding which is compatible with european words.,0
7871,this solution worked for me before encoding json.,0
7872,you can also encode string with utf-8 for html is iso-8859-1 doesn't work.,0
7874,the ajax function is using get for the method but in the api.php script you are attempting to use $_post['categoryid'] so perhaps you ought to change that to $_get['categoryid'],0
7876,"to test to see if the onchange event is actually firing, use the console ( most browsers nowadays have the console ) and open the network tab.",0
7877,"try unsetting variables that are not needed and vacating memory before line 39. also, continue to clean the code that follows.",0
7878,"though not preferred, you can also increase the memory allocation in php.ini.",0
7879,make sure the columns have indexes to achieve faster results.,0
7880,the query also needs to use 'limit' if you are sure about the number of results that needs to be retrieved.,0
7882,if you are using too much array so after using it please unset it so it will release some memory for other execution.,0
7883,"ie: unset($array) please increase memory limit in your php.ini or use php function ini_set('memory_limit','128m'); or use .htaccess file to override memory_limit",0
7885,"what you should be doing is using the :: operator to specificy that your accessing the method of a class, and not an object:",0
7886,"one thing you need to understand, is that once you echo something in php, it leaves your server, and is completely separated from your php code.",0
7887,"the only way your output code in html can delete something in php, is if you use form post/ajax call.",0
7888,"1) create a php page that outputs your html page content.2) create another php page that accepts a call from your html page with an id of the item you wish to delete ( google php $_post variable )3) create a javascript ""delete"" function, that gets called when user clicks the delete button.",0
7889,"jquery(""textfield_id"").val() &lt;--- returns a value from an input.",0
7890,your label is not an input.,0
7891,and then your page.php file would contain something like this.,0
7892,im not going into more details because it is allot to cover.,0
7894,the result of print_r($temp_rows) coming like this array ( [0] =&gt; 123 [1] =&gt; 234 [2] =&gt; 312),0
7896,one way to do it (without changing any of your files) is like so:,0
7897,"we then replace the current page's #class select element with the version in the generated data (wrapped in $() to create dom elements from the stringified html, so we can use find() ).",0
7898,"another way might be to have files, getsubjects.php , getclasses.php , and so on, and post individually to them (you make the first request onload , and subsequent requests onchange ).",0
7899,"this way, you can just append the generated option elements to the select elements on the page.",0
7900,"also: please please please sanitize $_post[""subject""] before using it in a database query.",0
7902,you can use prepared statements for this (mysqli has the prepare() function to prepare a statement before querying).,0
7903,more on that and combating sql injection here .,0
7904,"ps: your query is vulnerable to sql injection, by interpolating unsafe values $month and $days directly into your query.",0
7905,"you should use a whitelist method to ensure these inputs match real table and column names in your database, don't just trust the user input.",0
7907,"if this is a new application, you should start using mysqli or pdo before investing more time into using the deprecated api.",0
7909,"alter the names of the elements so that instead of name=""myname"" and name=""myname2"" , name=""mayname3"" you have name=""myname[0]"" and name=""myname[1]"" , name=""myname[2]"" .",0
7910,"so that in the $_post array you will have $_post['myname'] as an array will al original and cloned values and not $_post['myname'] , $_post['myname2'] , $_post['myname3'] .",0
7911,"depending on the way you want to hanlde that you could also have original elements with names like name=""form[0][myname]"" and the others like name=""form[1][myname]"" , etc.",0
7912,"at the end the original elements values are on $_post['form'][0] and the others in $_post['form'][1] , $_post['form'][2] , etc.",0
7913,"your requisition need ""precise syntax description"", and a lot of examples for assert your description.",0
7914,"only 3 or 4 examples is not enough, is very open.",0
7915,"if you want to get exactly line 59 of the data returned from $newurl and you're not worried about it being that large, you could just use file($newurl)[58] .",0
7916,"if you're talking about the data from curl , you can use explode(""\n"", $data) to get a similar array.",0
7917,array_insert2's second param is the position.,0
7918,"in the first code you are actually giving it an integer making it a valid position ( $p, combined with the array_splice function ).",0
7919,"in the second piece of code, the position supplied to array_insert2 is the key ( $k ) from the foreach loop on $results[$p].",0
7920,the key given cannot be used correctly with the array_splice function.,0
7921,"maybe instead of supplying $k, give the array_search result of $k in $results[$p].",0
7922,"short-answer:the position supplied in the second piece of code is not an integer, making it not usable for the array_splice function.",0
7925,it seems that that the job is not a variable its a index for the array.,0
7928,do you have a script that always runs before each page executes?,0
7929,"if not, this is a great place to set up any utility functions or initialize variables, like $_session['login'] .",0
7930,you can set a default false value for $_session['login'] there.,0
7931,"then you have a reliable default value, which is a good practice for a variable that's important, like this one.",0
7932,you could use this to check if it's set and assign a default:,0
7935,sometimes it's useful to get those warnings.,0
7937,"at the top of each page, you run session_start() before anything else.",0
7938,"this will load any existing session, or start a new one if none exists.",0
7939,this regex seems to work on your example.,0
7941,"when i was facing this problem, it appeared that in several instances, there was actually two cookies by the same name.",0
7942,"one of them was the php created cookie, the other was the javascript created cookie.",0
7944,"it was problematic that the loading of a fresh page which caused the cookie's desired ""new"" value to be read.",0
7945,so one way to deal with php's late cookie update effect is to both use the cookie methods available to it and also just setting $_cookie['yourcookiename'] = $val as well.,0
7948,i added mysqli_real_escape_string to help some.,0
7949,you are using the oop calls so you dont need to have the $db parameter inside the parameters,0
7951,"as for the second, there is no function validate_email.",0
7952,you should also be using jinput instead of $_post or $_get calls:,0
7953,"looking at your query, it should looking something like this:",0
7955,so if you do an echo or print_r you would see something like this:,0
7957,before i begin i want to recommend you something: avoid the use of the while statetements.,0
7958,unless they are really needed - like in the exact way they are used in the php docs (and even then you can find alternatives) - they should be avoided all the time.,0
7959,i present the motive down under.,0
7960,"after you change it, you still remain with the issue: an infinite loop .",0
7961,because you are using a while loop without changing the state of the loop condition.,0
7962,e.g_ you are validating the $notification array for beeing existent.,0
7965,"situation, you can use the following codes.",0
7966,notice the difference: $notification is valid only for the period of a loop step.,0
7967,after each iteration $notification is newly created.,0
7968,"and, when mysqli_fetch_assoc() returns false on the (last + 1)-iteration step, then the $notification receives that value and, therefore, the loop ends.",0
7969,"or, if you want to fetch the results in an array and to output its items later, then you can do it like this:",0
7971,use exception handling in order to catch all errors and handle them correspondingly.,0
7972,especially when you run database operations.,0
7974,"you will still be writing 'old' mysql statements, because 'mysqli' is an improved driver (hence, the ""i"") to take advantage of features in mysql >= 4.1. it is considered 'dual procedural and object-oriented api'.",0
7975,"for instance, to connect to your mysql db, you could do either of the following :",0
7977,if you look closely you can see that i have added the value attribute to the html which will be the value when the browser reloads.,0
7978,this will only work if you post the data to the same page!,0
7979,"you need to alter the code such that ""if"" prizeticket has one item, it does one thing, ""else"" it does something else.",0
7980,this is a good place to use a function.,0
7982,the problem is that you don't set the returned value of str_replace() function,0
7983,you can explode() the string by a space and array_shit() the first element.,0
7984,simply use the explode() function to split each element by a single space and take the first element of the resulting split.,0
7985,you need to pass the $index to the delete method and remove that item from data object,0
7986,i am using a custom function working with pdo... i can post the function here if you need to,0
7989,"therefore, to accomplish what it seems you're trying to do, you'd write:",0
7990,"i would guess that if uid isn't set in the request, $this-&gt;input-&gt;get will return null or false or some such.",0
7991,"you don't need isset , the return value should already be falsey .",0
7992,"the best thing to do is to put the possible choices in an array, iterate over it when generating the form element, and use in_array() to validate it.",0
7993,first of all you need to add error_reporting() on in your code:,0
7994,if you want associative index than you need to use associative array as:,0
7995,now you can use as you need.,0
7997,i don't know why are mixing procedural and objected oriented style together.,0
7998,one thing first about how you access the get variables.,0
7999,"you check the value using $_get[""pg""] == false .",0
8000,note that this expression will fail to do what you expect in a lot situations.,0
8002,"the only way it will equal to false if it is empty or unset (in which case you will also get a compiler warning, which you should avoid).",0
8003,"usually a safer way to check if the value was set is using isset( $_get[""pg""] ) .",0
8004,the next thing i want to address is a security problem you introduce.,0
8005,you use the get value directly to include a file with that name.,0
8006,"if i was a user with malicious intent, i could easily set the pg value to something, you usually wouldn't expect and which break your website in some way.",0
8007,"you generally should avoid using data the user entered somehow (request parameters are user data), and make sure to sanitize them first.",0
8008,"a good way to do this, when you plan to use the value as a base to which page you want to include, would be to have some kind of whitelist of acceptable/allowed values.",0
8009,"then you can check if the entered data is in that whitelist and if that is the case, include the correct page.",0
8010,another simple way would be using a switch statement to simply go through all accepted cases.,0
8011,"now finally, onto your problem: i'm not sure if this was just a mistake when you posted the code, but file 1 is missing the include of file 2. as such you will never include file 3, and of course the variable will never be set.",0
8012,another problem might be the usage of the get value.,0
8013,"if the value does not contain the exact filename (as in casing and no extra whitespace), then the file won't be found.",0
8016,"finally, you should enable error reporting on your server, you can do that either in your server configuration, or by adding the following line to the top of your first file (i.e.",0
8017,"your code seems to be good, but i think you have a problem with your display (it is interpreted as html tag) :",0
8018,"if you look at your source, or if you try with htmlentities , you should get all",0
8019,"you should use var_export instead of var_dump , which allows you to store its output in a variable rather than print it using:",0
8020,get the number of lines in the terminal using an exec() call to tput lines get the size of your var_dump by using var_export() as anubhava mentions.,0
8023,on another side you can make a for(or foreach) loop where your,0
8026,another thing is try to name your variables more describing.,0
8028,?you should consider using mysqli instead mysql.,0
8029,i think in php7 it is deprecated(if i am not wrong),0
8031,good practices take long time to apply.,0
8034,you can use fetch() in combination with bind_result to retrieve the data.,0
8035,there may be other ways as well.,0
8037,then where you call that function you'll need to pass in the $mysqli object:,0
8038,as long as you don't care about any of the url parameters you can use explode .,0
8039,have a look at your php.ini settings.,0
8040,"in particular, you want to set session.auto_start to 0 if you are manually doing session_start() .",0
8041,"and if you're relying on the session cookie or transparant url rewriting, you will need session.use_cookies=1 and/or session.use_trans_sid=1 as well.",0
8042,"first of all, a couple of questions : (they matter at least if none of these suggestion does the trick)",0
8043,is there always a problem when you are browsing the site ?,0
8044,is it still present when you are accessing the site from another browser ?,0
8045,what about from another computer ?,0
8046,"if you use something like var_dump($_session); die; at the end of the script that sets data in session, what does it give ?",0
8047,second idea (at least if you are on windows) : did you try disabling you antivirus / firewall ?,0
8048,is the session cookie correctly created in the client's browser ?,0
8049,if you are using sub-domains (or not) : is the cookie's domain ok ?,0
8050,what about it's expiration date ?,0
8051,another one : are you sure there is absolutly nothing that gets to the output before the session_start ?,0
8052,"but, if i remember correctly, not that you can modify them",0
8054,you are posting the form but looking at the get result,0
8055,your first issue is that arrays start at [0] so if you have two values in the new talentline array then the first is key [0] and the second value is key [1] .,0
8056,"your second issue is related in that because you're comparing the key values in the anonymous function, you are looking for the first value (array key [0] ) by asking for value number 1 as given by the $_get array.",0
8057,this is why it's giving you the uexpected (but correct) results.,0
8058,"you need to adjust the key value by either increasing the key values by +1 or to decrease the input reference values by -1, to make the input align with the given csv values:",0
8059,"$value is a copy of the array element, so when you unset parts of it you're not affecting the original array.",0
8060,"if you want it to be the actual array element, use a reference variable:",0
8061,"you're nearly there with your loop, however $value is not a key within the $key variable.",0
8062,if you print_r your $keywords you will see that the $key variable will be the string on the left side of the =&gt; and the $value on the right.,0
8063,alternate fix (if you have a too old version of php that you cant do the anonymous functions above),0
8065,"refer to pdo support for multiple queries (pdo_mysql, pdo_mysqlnd)",0
8066,"in my personal opinion, i think this is bad practice to put multiple queries into one pdo statement.",0
8067,you should consider using a transaction with pdo and multiple statements which allows you to more easily figure which query is causing issues and rollback if an error occurs.,0
8068,"secondly, you are using prepared statements but are still not protecting yourself from sql injections.",0
8069,don't use $_post in the prepare().,0
8070,you are supposed to bind those after you prepare the statement.,0
8075,"the correct way, is to use prepared statements .",0
8078,when using prepared statements there is no need for this.,0
8079,to get rid of the quantity string for whatever reason just unset($results[0]); .,0
8080,"in your fetch.php file, you'll need to access the $id via $_get again.",0
8081,"i'm sticking within the scope of your question here, but something to note is that you best sanitize that information.",0
8082,especially if you're going to use it in a database query!,0
8083,you can't echo or have an if inside an echo for a start.,0
8086,to me this code is doing exactly what you've told it to do and the result of both a function as well as a class method (using the same code) are identical... see the working 3v4l pastebin here .,0
8088,"specifically, this function will return at the very first match of the $needle in the $haystack .",0
8089,"such that the following array, returns 0 (_that is with a needle of 'foo' ).",0
8090,it will also return only the key of the outer-most array in the $haystack .,0
8091,"meaning, the following array returns 0 as the key.",0
8092,even though the actual match is in $haystack[0][1][2],0
8095,"so for example, always return a boolean ( true on success and false on failure) rather than return false on failure and the key on success.",0
8096,this makes checking the function's result easier and clearer from the caller's perspective.,0
8098,"finally, consider avoiding multiple return points in the same function as this makes debugging harder.",0
8099,so a cleaner way to write the same code might be something like this:,0
8101,notice you also don't have to use exact match if you wanted to add an optional argument for $strict at the end of the function there and also be more inline with in_array .,0
8102,so it sounds like the problem is you might have some arbitrary value for $key so you don;t know how to get all of them.,0
8104,the inoput might look like this:,0
8105,"i think that not using reg-ex here is actually a better method since you are looking for special reg-ex chars, and they do not have to be escaped if you use strpos() .",0
8106,"not sure, your code needs some improvement.",0
8108,all of this could easily be done with a simple class.,0
8110,"it is not visible with only the partial php code you posted, and you should post the whole code if not too heavy.",0
8112,"btw, you should also ensure to exit; after echoing message responding to ajax call.",0
8113,"first off, i strongly recommend you don't listen to anyone telling you to set it as global.",0
8114,"a more robust version includes by wrapping your functions into classes (and instantiating objects from those classes), and passing the pdo object (or some sort of factory object) to the constructor of that object.",0
8115,"then it would be ""globally"" available throughout the methods (functions) of that object.",0
8116,your trainers.php script actually does have access to $db .,0
8117,"for example, if you added var_dump($db) as the first line of trainers.php , you would see you have access to it.",0
8118,the problem you are having is that the functions within trainers.php do not have access to $db within the scope of the function.,0
8119,there are really a few ways to handle this.,0
8120,as the first line within each function you want to provide access to the $db variable that is in global scope.,0
8121,another way would be to simply pass the db object as a parameter to every function that needs access to it like this (dependency injection):,0
8122,"a final (and in my opinion best) way to do this if you build a singleton class around your pdo object and get the pdo object from that, guraneeting only a single instance will ever be created.",0
8124,"using bind_result does this automatically for you, and you don't have to repeat it each time through the fetch loop.",0
8125,it's basically just a stylistic choice.,0
8126,"imho, the main problem with bind_result is that you have to make sure to keep the order of the arguments in sync with the select list.",0
8128,then check if the field is not empty .,0
8129,"if it is not empty and (most likely) filled in by the spambot, then make it die(); or redirect.",0
8130,"first of all, i honestly don't recommend this as a spam/bot deterrent - there are many well tested third party libraries out there for you to use.",0
8131,"having said that, i've edited your code with some minor improvements.",0
8132,is this what you're trying to achieve?,0
8133,"also, you should be validating each of the fields e.g.",0
8134,"checking whether they're empty, of the right format and length etc.",0
8135,"preg_match() is an awesome way of doing this, plus you can add some minor validation at the client side as well.",0
8136,you are probably doing one of these two things wrong:,0
8137,"if the content-type is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded , cors must send a preflight request.",0
8138,"that means that the browser will send before doing the post request an options request, which is used to determine if the post request is allowed.",0
8139,take a look here how this works.,0
8140,"secondly, if you use xhr.setrequestheader(""content-type"", ""application/json"") , the $_post parameters will not be filled with parameters, this is only the case for application/x-www-form-urlencoded.",0
8141,"to get the json you send, you will have to do:",0
8145,turns out that the protocol i was using to connect to sql server via pdo limits to 255 characters when fetching from a varchar column.,0
8147,so the user can't ever modify $_session['username'] .,0
8148,"the only thing you have to really be wary of with sessions is session hijacking (where a user gets the session id of another logged in user, and uses it to pose as that user)",0
8149,"comparing across a number of php versions , it looks like this will work for php 5.3.15+ and php 5.4.5+.",0
8150,"then in php you can access the multidimensional array using $_post['prods'] , you can loop through each one using a foreach like this:",0
8151,"you're not pulling the session variable, but assigning $campaignid to literally the string $_session[campaignid] .",0
8153,"note: if $dr_img_scores1 or $dr_img_scores2 are not in order, you can use ksort() on them to synchronize their orders to permit an easy visual comparison of scores.",0
8154,"if you want to transfer the data to a table then a good approach could be to explode() the string by &amp; then explode() each element by ; using array_map() ,",0
8155,first you need to set session_start() .,0
8156,then your problem is because after getting logged in first time and setting session you don't redirect your page.,0
8158,"when you again submit it is already set, so it shows you logged in.",0
8160,this is questionable but feel i need to mention it.,0
8161,if you indeed have a function called start_session(); ok. if not then that may need to be changed to session_start();,0
8162,normalize each value to only contain the value you want to look for extact duplicates ( strtok docs ).,0
8163,remove duplicates from the array ( array_unique docs ).,0
8165,the hash is representing the comparison value of the original value.,0
8166,then unique the hashes (and you actually want only the hashes).,0
8167,"if the outcome does not suit your needs, you need to adopt the hash function.",0
8168,i had chosen strtok as it seemed suitable for your (original) case.,0
8169,"however if looking for a delimiter get's more complicated, you might look for regular expressions to specifiy a delimiter, like preg_split docs or preg_replace docs .",0
8170,"once $test_array is no longer in scope (and there are no additional references that point to it), it is flagged for garbage collection.",0
8171,it ceases to be in scope when the process returns from the function to the calling routine.,0
8172,so there is no need to unset it.,0
8173,this would only be different if you had declared $test_array as static,0
8174,"when you create the activation link, store a unix timestamp with it in its record in the table",0
8175,"furthermore, you do not want to use simple numeric activation keys.",0
8176,you should generate long random strings that can't easily be guessed.,0
8179,but you could invert the return result of preg_match function ie.,0
8180,"for example, if you wanted to match an a or e , you'd write [ae] .",0
8181,"if you wanted to match grey or gray , you'd write gr[ae]y .",0
8182,"as said above, character classes match a single character from the list.",0
8183,"here, you're using ^ to get a negated character class, so this will match a single character that's not in the supplied list.",0
8184,"in this case, our list contains the following characters:",0
8186,it now checks for the absense of any of the following characters:,0
8189,"unlike character classes, alternation works with a regex.",0
8190,"a simple string, say foo is also a valid regular expression.",0
8193,use alternation when you want to match between n number of strings.,0
8194,"if you want to achieve this directly using a regex, then you may want to use look-arounds.",0
8195,"if this is exactly what you're trying to do, then you don't need a regular expression at all.",0
8197,"not only it will be faster, it will be more readable too.",0
8200,there is definitely something fishy if a 700kb file eats up 140mb of memory with that code you gave (you could unset $relation at the end of the each iteration though).,0
8201,consider using a debugger to step through it to see what happens.,0
8202,you might also want to consider rewriting the code to use splfileobject's csv functions as well ( or their procedural cousins ),0
8203,"the name element on the textarea needs to have the name news_item in this instance as this is what your looking for in your post request, $_post['news_item'] .",0
8204,a brutal way would be to store the orientation change in a cookie through jquery and access it with the $_cookie variable in php.,0
8205,"a quick fix would look like this, where user doesn't extend database, because it's wrong.",0
8208,"if you want to do it properly, in an object-oriented way.",0
8209,remember php doesn't allow multiple inheritances by extend.,0
8210,"tomorrow, you might want to have a person class that every user will extend, but since you did it wrong in the beginning, and wasting precious extend on database, it won't be possible.",0
8211,"and by not having a control of how many database instances you have created, you will run into issues.",0
8212,"you need to know for sure that you have only a single connection object for one database, if of course the opposite is a must - which in your case i doubt.",0
8213,"of course this will change if you have multiple database requirements, and more sophisticated app structure.",0
8216,"you're exploding order number: 12345 as :- explode('order number: ', $newline); and therefore your required value is in the 0 offset of your array.",0
8217,passwords are probably hashed first you must determine which hashing function used at storing passwords at your database.,0
8218,then you can do it like below i assumed passwords are hashed using md5 which is widely used but exploitable but if password is also salted im afraid you have to learn salt word too else it is next to impossible based on used hashing algorithm.,0
8219,also using this way to access to database is really vulnerable i really suggest for you to look into pdo .,0
8220,"if you aren't using any js plugins like select2 or bootstrap-select , then you have http://jsfiddle.net/nyl7d/ this possibility, but we need work a bit to reach it.",0
8222,"note that {{ choice.label|raw }} raw filter displays the raw text stored (it prevents from being escaped) into label, in this case the icon font content.",0
8223,"finally, you need to register the form theme like describe the documentation :",0
8224,"the first function returns the url, the second function should return an array of arrays... you will have the standard index, with ""category_id"" and ""url"" as nested/sub arrays... (if in doubt, just do a print_r of the return value to see what i mean)",0
8226,"if needed, you could also use $_get instead of $data , when calling parse_str() .",0
8227,"$_cookie is set when the page loads so if you want immediate access, you can set $_cookie['variable'] direct.",0
8228,the reason is that $_cookie[$cookie] returns the current cookie sent by the browser.,0
8230,"when you retrieve the value $_cookie[$cookie] , the cookie is not yet set because it will be set after the page is requested.",0
8232,i'm not 100% familiar with mysqli but i've played with a lot of pgsql commands doing this sort of thing and i think what your looking for is mysqli-result->fetch_assoc .,0
8233,this will produce an associative array that you can loop over pretty easily like so:,0
8234,edit: alnitak has linked to better explanation than i have in the comments for this answer.,0
8235,create a session variable called 'created' which holds the timestamp of the moment when the variable was created.,0
8236,now on every page load you check if 3 days have passed.,0
8237,if 3 days have passed you unset the session variables and destroy the session.,0
8238,"if you do a simple explode line by line, this will give you the count:",0
8239,"when i went to the database, everything was there as it should be:",0
8240,"the only things that i did, really was to remove the quotes from the variables and just changed the way that it connects to the database.",0
8241,"neither of those should have affected anything, though, so i'm not sure.",0
8242,try pasting my code into your script and see if that works.,0
8243,"that being said, it's got to be something with another part of your script that's wonky.",0
8245,"meaning, is your connection set up properly and you don't have to specify a host, username or password?",0
8247,check to make sure your message looks like that as well.,0
8248,you are posting in json format so you need to grab the post with file_get_contents('php://input') and then decode it so that you have it as an array.,0
8249,your pdo object gets stored in a local variable ( $db ) in the constructor.,0
8250,"assign it to the property ( $_pdo ) instead, because your query() method is calling $this-&gt;_pdo-&gt;prepare() .",0
8251,"however, i do think you are not using the right way to store your tags; they should be stored in a separate table as separate values.",0
8253,"if you really wanted to get a single dimensional array without having this multidimensional thing going on, all you really need to do is utilize another loop within that loop.",0
8256,(at some ftp clients you have to update the directory to see new files.),0
8257,i took your script and used it on my server.,0
8259,another way would be to use date_default_timezone_set(utc);//use your own timezone here.,0
8260,"as long as date throws errors, your filestring might not be build correctly.",0
8263,"by the way, you might know already, but there is an entry in php manual page on uploading multiple files",0
8264,you always have to match the exact case.,0
8265,"you should create only one pdo instance, e.g.",0
8266,it should be passed as argument to each function that uses it.,0
8267,"of course, transfer style attributes to classes.",0
8269,i gave you a general view by throwing only exception .,0
8270,normally you should throw and handle the spl (standard php library) subtypes of it.,0
8271,"always read in the php manual what php functions are returning so that you can correctly apply handle cases (exceptions, bools, etc).",0
8272,use strpos to find first tag position.,0
8273,then find ending tag also with strpos .,0
8274,i mean - if u know from where to what you are looking for and they are unique.. so what matter in preg_* functions?,0
8275,so i guess something like this will work fine (i make code clear as possible for understanding my idea in step-by-step actions):,0
8276,"i believe the source of the issue here is that when using a palette based image, such as the one you have created by calling imagecreate() , it is possible to declare the same color at multiple indexes within the palette.",0
8277,"there are two things that you could do about this, the first and probably easiest is just to use a true-color image, which is just a simple case of changing imagecreate($width, $height); to imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height); .",0
8278,"if you want to stick with the palette-based image (for example for reasons of output image data size - with an image containing so few colors, a palette-based image will be considerably smaller), you will need to cache the allocated colors manually so you can re-use them, something like this:",0
8282,"first at all, some theory about html tags: a tag starts with a &lt; followed by non-whitespace characters.",0
8283,if this string starts with a ?,0
8284,", it should not be parsed .",0
8286,"a comment is terminated with a --&gt; , inside such a comment, characters like &lt; and &gt; are allowed.",0
8287,"attributes can occur in tags, their values may optionally be surrounded by a quote character ( ' or "" ).",0
8288,"if such a quote exist, it must be closed, otherwise if a &gt; is encountered, the tag is not closed.",0
8289,"two buffers exist, one for the output, the other for ""inside html tags"".",0
8290,a counter named depth holds the number of open angle brackets ( &lt; ).,0
8292,the last character is stored in the variable lc .,0
8293,"by ""outside tags"", i mean not in tags as in &lt;a href=""in tag""&gt;outside tag&lt;/a&gt; .",0
8294,"text may contain &lt; and &gt; though, as in &gt;&lt; a&gt;&gt; .",0
8296,that can be done with htmlspecialchars() .,0
8297,"one way to do this, is to put $category inside a session variable.",0
8299,and then after the $category = $category + 1; you put:,0
8301,the subject itself could be a book but what you should research is autoloading which basically allows you to put your functions code in different files and let server to include these files when you call function used in one of these files.,0
8302,this way you will be able to split code responsible for database connection and for performing data operations (fetching/updating/deleting).,0
8303,"second, drop mysqli and move to pdo (or even better to dbal when you discover what composer is).",0
8304,i know that internet is full of examples based on mysqli but this method is just on it's way out and it is not coming back.,0
8306,"never, ever put external variables into query like this:",0
8308,using prepared statements in pdo your query would look like this:,0
8309,if i understand you correctly you would like to have some field to input ship name and button to show its details after clicking into it.,0
8310,standard form - you just create standard html form and submit it with button click redirecting it to itself (or other page).,0
8311,in file where you would like to show results you just use function selectyacht getting ship name from post and passing it to function selectyacht and then just printing it's results (field by field in places you need them) ajax form - if you prefer doing it without reloading original page - sending field value representing ship name via ajax to other page where you use selectyacht function and update page with java script,0
8313,however this is not the case.,0
8314,$_post data is attached with an http request.,0
8316,this would explain why $_session['tourselected'] is unset when you get to your second script.,0
8317,"that said, if your only goal is to send data from the form built in alloment.php to alloment_report.php you shouldn't be using sessions at all.",0
8318,all of this can be done with only $_post .,0
8319,you should use get instead of modify your script to use post.,0
8321,new way : all you gotta do is create a new pdo object.,0
8326,"tip: keep $conn = new pdo( db_dsn, db_username, db_password ); outside the foreach loop.",0
8327,no need to repeat the connection on each loop,0
8328,"they are there for a good reason, then your if would expand to:",0
8330,"in the next call, $_cookie will be filled, there is no need to fill it by yourself.",0
8332,"the same problem with the character set applies to pdo prepared statements, so pdo is the recommended way, but it does not make you safe in this case.",0
8334,"take care that you use utf-8 for the connection object, as well as for the html page, this avoids a lot of problems.",0
8335,"assuming you have the email addresses in indivudual strings in the database, you might be combining them with \n in the textarea, then explodeing on \n ... but if you're running windows then the lines are separated by \r\n , so you'd be comparing email@example.com with email@example.com\r , which is different.",0
8336,"this would cause the entire array to be listed, without any visible cause.",0
8337,it will be always true so you'll always get 500 error page.,0
8338,"now, if someone use today as $day it will be if (false || true) it it evaluates to true , same if it's tomorrow .",0
8339,you should rather don't do it in your controller or middleware.,0
8340,you can user route parameters as in 5.1 ( https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/routing#route-parameters ) - i haven't tested it but it should work or (this is recommended) you should use for example form validation request to accomplish that.,0
8341,you can group array elements and then do unset to whole group.,0
8342,you have an on-prem hosted application that uses active directory to authenticate to your on-prem sql server.,0
8344,you do not have the option to change the authentication method for sql.,0
8345,so you dirsync your directory to azure ad and use windows authentication to connect to azure sql.,0
8346,$_server['remote_addr'] is the only reliable ip address you'll get - it's extracted directly from the tcp stack and is where the current connection was established from.,0
8347,"this means if the user is connecting via a proxy, you'll get the proxy's address, not the user's.",0
8348,"any of the other header-based ones are unreliable, as http headers are trivial to forge.",0
8349,"you can use the information from them, if you'd like, as long as you don't trust it.",0
8350,"since $dbc is a mysqli object, mysqli::query() returns a mysqli_result object on a successful query.",0
8351,"this means that $result is not going to be the single value you expect it to be; instead, it's going to be an object that represents the entire response to the query.",0
8352,you will want to do something like this to actually get the value of your clear column:,0
8353,you can then use $clear to update your database in the second query.,0
8354,(you can't easily do this in one query because the column you are modifying depends on the value of a row in the database.,0
8355,"doing this in entirely in one query may be possible, but is probably also more trouble than it's worth.)",0
8356,"if the query returns no rows, $row will be null.",0
8357,so you will need to check for this.,0
8360,"since $clear is used as a column name, and you can't parameterize column names, you will need to take extra care to ensure that it is valid.",0
8361,"first of all, add a unique index to your users table, like this: alter table users add unique(username) after this you won't need to worry about name duplication: mysql will throw an error (but please be careful and handle errors properly).",0
8362,use the where clause as suggested in a comment.,0
8363,so you won't need to loop through a large number of rows to find one single row.,0
8364,use parameterized queries and prepared statements.,0
8365,"as you're using pdo (which is, i believe, one of the best things you could do with php and mysql), this shouldn't be a hard thing to do.",0
8366,so you'll be secure from (most of the) sql injections.,0
8367,queries in loops are a really bad thing to do because this slows down your whole website.,0
8369,"don't use mysqli for that if you can avoid it, it'll just give you headaches.",0
8370,"if you really want to use mysqli, the approach you'd use is similar but instead of providing the data in execute() you'd have to either make a very complicated single bind_param call (involving call_user_func_array() unless the number of elements in your array is fixed) or loop over making several bind_param calls.",0
8371,"you need to escape characters, to stop them from breaking your sql statements.",0
8372,i recommend you read up on sql injections.,0
8373,"i think this is taken care of automatically in the mysqli extension, which you should be using as this method is depreciated nowadays.",0
8374,the problem is you are printing your array at wrong place.it is inside loop right now that's whay it is printing in that manner.just remove it inside while() loop and put it outside loop.,0
8376,"you'll want to use if(isset($_post)) (else you will get php notices) and try to change your action from """" to ""#"" , also add the name=""submit"" attribute to your submit button.",0
8379,"if you do it this way, $i should become unneccessary.",0
8380,"you can use similar_text function, which calculates the similarity between two strings.",0
8381,note that complexity is o(n**3) where n is the length of the longest string.,0
8382,"while you learn mysqli or pdo , do this to your code",0
8385,"as a side note, the error message ""wrong password"" is misleading.",0
8386,"first of all, it could have been the username which was wrong as well.",0
8387,"second of all, never provide an unauthorized user with more information than they already have.",0
8388,"if you tell an attacker that they got a username right and just got the password wrong, you've given them have of the login information.",0
8389,"if anything doesn't match in the login, simply say that the login has failed.",0
8390,"then you can access the fields via $results['first_name'], for example.",0
8391,"(you may want to make sure that the section ( $name_of_picture ) and directive ( faces ) exist, see isset() .)",0
8392,"as you said that you pass the $_post['picup'] from the first submit, just simply modify your second form and put the $_post['picup'] value in the hidden field.",0
8393,so there is a profile.php which contains and shows the uploaded pictures.,0
8394,i want want to use a button which increase the limit in sql.,0
8395,there is a div which contains the pictures wit query result and after it have the load more button.,0
8397,first of all when the profile.php is loaded the pictures are shows if you have one but its limited to shown only 3 at first.,0
8398,so after you click the load more button it runs the ajax code which increase the limit variable with 3 so we get a new number which is 6 now (i always increase with 3).,0
8399,the ajax code first send the data to the given url which is the show_more.php in this case.,0
8400,i write it in oop so i have a class which handle all the image thing and i have a function in it which show the images so i just pass a variable in it like this public function showimg($limit){...} .,0
8401,so here is where the magic happens.,0
8403,after when it's happened in ajax code the success part handle the result.,0
8404,the result will the html code which will be added to the image container.,0
8405,"you are forgetting to execute your query, you are only preparing it:",0
8406,also there was a typo in the delete command.,0
8407,a limit in the delete queries is never a bad idea.,0
8408,should be using mysqli_query.just please be sure to change $link with the connection result (of mysqli_connect).,0
8409,your negative lookahead isn't working because there is nothing to look ahead at.,0
8411,you will still need to account for the filename extension characters.,0
8412,a better approach would be to use pathinfo() though.,0
8415,"if you don't need to keep your arrays separate for anything else, you could just combine them yourself and remove the array_combine.",0
8418,"this returns an object of type mysqli_stmt , which then acts as a container for the query you are building.",0
8419,"as such, you should pass this as the first parameter to mysqli_stmt_prepare , mysqli_stmt_bind_param and mysqli_stmt_execute .",0
8421,this might be a bad idea if you have to handle telephone numbers starting with 0 (common in the uk for example) at any point.,0
8422,you have wrong order of arguments.,0
8424,it is an obsolette database api with a lot of vulnerabilities.,0
8425,switch to mysqli or pdo instead,0

8525,"one thing you should do though, is add code to handle the cases where the query fails to execute and where no row is fetched from the database.",0

8566,"what you're attempting to do here has been done many, many times before, so don't think you're trying to reinvent the wheel!",0
8567,the general premise is something like this:,0
8570,"for post, the values will be stored in the body of the message, represented in jquery $.ajax by the data field.",0
8571,the php page will make the mysqli call to the database based off of what was in the $_get[] or $_post[] variable (depending on if you used get or post).,0
8572,this is where things like sql injection prevention (i.e.,0
8573,"the php page returns results, normally as json (javascript object notation), but technically can be anything that you will eventually interpret with json the json call takes the results returned and does what you need it to do with them",0
8574,"there's a few technologies involved there, but the general idea is that the client (jquery) cannot talk to the database directly, it has to go through the server.",0
8576,"using named parameters in pdo, you can't use the same name more than once, unless you do:",0
8577,"but if you do that, the values for :skip will be interpolated into the query as quoted strings, which are not valid in the context of limit.",0
8578,"or else interpolate the value into the query yourself, without quoting the integer.",0
8580,"if nothing else, '%search%' works for both of the other two patterns: 'search%' and '%search' .",0
8581,you don't have to search all three.,0
8582,this will cause $_post['id'] to be an array of all the checked values.,0
8585,"you can use it with id in (...) , but you can't do parameter substitution with this because the number of elements isn't known.",0
8586,so the loop is th best way to do it.,0
8587,your issue means that you aren't successfully running the query.,0
8588,"while we may be able to guess the issue with your query, it would be better for you to be able to determine the error exactly.",0
8589,"to troubleshoot this, you'll need to display the error that mysql is encountering:",0
8591,"implode returns a string, so it is only natural that json_encode encodes it as such.",0

8611,"in short, now it will only except integer values.",0
8612,you could also use the filter_var() method explained in deceze's post.,0
8613,also you can use some mod_rewrite rules to prevent hotlinking of your files.,0
8614,"if it is really a security issue to you, you will need to control the access.",0

8618,"if you need it to be done by php only - use the principle of breaking the keys to array by explode( ""\s"" , $words ); - that will give you an array of symbols only and then loop to replace the string for each word in the array.",0

8622,what else you do is added bonus.,0
8623,yes (opinions will differ here from person to person) for preventing sql injection (assuming you are using prepared statement).,0
8624,though i prefer storing the raw data in database even if it means sacrificing for some malicious xss code may contain it.,0
8625,use htmlpurifier (with a view that you are outputting from a database.),0
8626,validate input and store it using prepared statements.,0

8631,"now, in your module php file you can call your helper like this:",0

8654,there are many ways to handle this ( like using ajax and saving everything without the need of forms or refreshing the page.),0
8655,but since you said you are new to php and you already started in this way so... what i can suggest is that....,0
8656,1) for every input you have you must give it an id and name.,0
8657,so your inputs should look like this (you can set the same name and id for the same field but every field must be unique):,0
8658,this way what you are doing is whenever a submit button pressed you try and check the two values and save them again both of them.,0
8659,the way i usually do this is by using javascript and ajax so i dont have to refresh the page also...,0
8660,"answer to side-quest: ""can anyone provide me with a guide or reading on how to beautify the message as its so plain"".",0
8661,when you send the mail as html you might apply css styles to your html.,0
8663,you also need to prepare your output for output to the browser with something like htmlspecialchars($row[...]) .,0
8664,"that way you avoid potential problems if the output contains html tags (javascript, etc.",0

8669,you just need to set a cookie by using the setcookie function.,0
8670,"you could technically do this outside of a class, by calling $_cookie[$key] to call the value, but the benefit of this is that you have a working instance you can refer back to, you can do away with accessing the global variable $_cookie, and you can add additional logic in one place.",0
8671,this saves you the trouble of having to update each place you check for a cookie.,0
8672,"unless you are running facebook i doubt that strlen will be where your server will spend most of his resources, and you should keep using strlen.",0
8673,"secondly, i want to make you aware of the fact that xdebug greatly decreases performance of function calls, so if you are running xdebug you may get convoluted numbers.",0
8674,"so, in production (where you hopefully do not have xdebug installed) the difference is even smaller.",0
8675,it goes down from 6x to 2x.,0
8676,"thirdly, you should know that, even though there is a measurable difference, this difference only shows up if this code runs in a tight loop with millions of iterations.",0
8677,"in a normal web application the difference will not be measurable, it will go under in the noise of variance.",0
8678,in modern objectoriented web applications a single line that you write within a small class easily can be run several 100s of times to build a single web page.,0
8680,then in real world scenarios you might not work only with little strings but also with really big documents up to 3mb size or larger.,0

8786,"mysqli::real_escape_string() takes only 1 argument at a time, a string (unless using procedural, mysqli_real_escape_string() , then the first is the connection, then the string as the second) the $_post can't be accessed in that way, i highly doubt you have one field named all that.",0
8789,an example of that is given below.,0
8790,usage of php error-reporting would've likely mentioned something about undefined indexes when you use the current escape.,0
8791,"always (in development) let php give you the errors, by enabling error-reporting with error_reporting(e_all); ini_set(""display_errors"", 1); at the top of your file.",0
8794,http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-escape-string.php http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.prepare.php how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
8796,check variable before use lik isset($config['home']['url']) you can also use !empty($config['home']['url']),0
8797,i'm a bit of an idiot i guess.,0
8798,i was calling session_destroy() rather than session_unset() to clear things out at the top of my authentication script.,0
8799,this is actually to do with another attribute of the pdo connection that you may not have considered yet.,0
8801,"if you leave it unset it takes the default of true , which tells the extension to emulate the compilation.",0
8802,"in other words, it will wait until you issue the -&gt;execute() before the statement gets compiled and errors are reported.",0
8803,now you will get the message and the file will be created containing the error message,0
8807,so this is the equivalent of calling file(integer) where integer is the length of $_post['fname'] 's value.,0
8808,you can use the implode function to get your string back after you removed the first element of your array,0
8821,there is nothing wrong about that.,0
8822,"i don't think that you should use the $_session variable for that, because the user needs to see the error message only one time.",0
8823,"in your case, and in most cases, that's why it might make no sense to store it in a session.",0
8825,if you want to send data via the url you have to use a get request.,0
8826,"to do this, change the type of the request to get and give the object directly to the data parameter in your jquery, and use $_get instead of $_post in your php.",0
8827,finally note that you're not returning json - you're returning text.,0
8828,"if you want to return json, use json_encode and get the value in the parameter of the success handler function.",0
8829,"by this way, resulting $chunks is an array like this:",0
8830,"the problem that you are having, i suspect, is that only the checkboxes that are checked will be passed back to the server, whereas all the hidden fields will always be passed so the lengths of the arrays will differ and the keys wont correspond.",0
8831,the solution to this is actually relatively simple - you just need to specify the keys for the condition array so you can match the values up again.,0
8832,this ties the values in the $_post['condition'] array back up with the $_post['delete'] array so everything will match up again.,0
8835,"what we need to do is tie up the two inputs that are associated with each book, which means we need a set of key/value pairs that can be matched up.",0
8836,that sounds like an array to me.,0
8837,"but unlike the example above, the keys should be irrelevant to the data - they don't need to mean anything, because all we want is the data.",0
8838,what we need to do is specify every single key explicitly (no stack-style array pushes) and make the keys agnostic of the data they relate to.,0
8839,"...and then, when the form is submitted, we can do this:",0
8840,"i've spent a lot of time to try to do this following several approach with no luck, and finally find it out by myself a clean way to do this: compile &amp; install the extensions from php source .",0
8841,"download &amp; compile pdo_oci (and oci8 if needed) form php source packages, there are some tricks that you need to applied here, including:",0
8842,"i didn't notice you said ""submit in background"", does it mean you don't want a page load?",0
8843,you can do that with ajax...,0
8844,note 1: i'm using jquery from the url http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js choose the version you want and place it in your server instead.,0
8845,the gc_maxlifetime value is the number of seconds after which data will be seen as garbage and potentially cleaned up.,0
8846,"you'll want to make sure this value is set high enough so that your sessions aren't destroyed too early, but you can't rely on sessions being destroyed after this amount of time.",0
8850,you'll need to group the ternary operator expression:,0
8853,"you could first retrieve the categories, and then foreach categories retrieve the corresponding businesses.",0
8854,there is no sign of jquery in your question.,0
8855,"if you are developing an application, make sure to understand how it works or your project is doomed to failure.",0
8856,"jquery is a library for javascript, a client side programming language, that means this is the browser the user uses that is running the code (as html and css).",0
8858,"so you can not easily interact between them just with your own mind, there is no magic in it.",0
8859,browsers can natively submit a form with a submit button.,0
8861,"you can also use it to send data to the server with ajax features (e.g with jquery $.post({howifeelit:""good""}) ) and the server gives you some results (http inside).",0
8862,prefer the international language for programming.,0
8863,"(even if you love you mother tongue, i understand) this is more understandable and re-usable.",0
8866,look at one of the million tutorial on the web to learn basics.,0
8867,"(look at pdo, include, post and framework keywords)",0
8868,this line contains a typo (if it isn't a typo):,0
8869,"your pdoexception should also include the real error message, instead of just ""database error"":",0
8870,"as i said in a comment, this looks like an xy problem .",0
8871,"you don't actually need to increment the keys, you need to keep all the values (including when the keys are duplicate) and sort them by key.",0
8872,"i'll assume when two or more items have the same key, the order they come from the database must be kept in the final list.",0
8873,"now, you can retrieve the values from the array by iterating over each sub-array:",0
8874,if you don't care about the keys anymore and all you need is the list of $value after sorting then you can put the values into a new list in the double foreach above (instead of displaying them).,0
8875,or you can write it in a more compact way using array_reduce() and array_merge() :,0
8878,pdostatement::bindparam doesn't modify the query string that you passed to pdo::prepare .,0
8879,it replaces the placeholders with the value of the variable that you bound to it in the moment you execute the statement and the query is sent to the sql server.,0
8880,it looks like you have it as a comma separated list... so in order to do your unset you need to explode it before calling unset.,0
8881,but thats a bad way to do it.. you leave alot of room for error in terms of getting the indexes mixed up.,0
8882,you should just make it an array and let php serialize/unserialize it as part of the normal session behavior.,0
8883,"additionally instead of using generic ordered numeric indexes for the keys, use something unique to each product like the sku or the primary key from the db record.",0
8884,it seems that you have a comma-separated value as $_session['inh_cart'] .,0
8885,"it is a string, not an array.",0
8886,thus your use of [] syntax on a string is in essence doing something like:,0
8887,"also, you probably don't want to set/unset items in a cart via $_get .",0
8888,"this is a really bad idea, as as someone navigates your site using forward/back buttons they will (randomly in their mind) see their cart changed.",0
8889,"you're looking for http://[anything]/, and you want it to match everything before the trailing /",0
8890,"to get this into your database, you can use magento's built in functions.",0
8891,here is a guide on its usage: pdo tutorial 1,0
8892,here is a more in depth guide: pdo tutorial 2,0
8895,"if you can't use pdo for whatever reason, look up mysqli .",0
8897,just start sessions at the beginning of your 2nd php file and you can use $_session['user'],0
8898,"now you want to do it with your name as well, (since $_session['user'] =email).just do the same but instead of 'user' use something like 'name'",0
8899,"the problem is you're doing the implode inside the while loop, it should be done outside after building your final array.",0
8901,"however, this should not be the case as you should be using concat when doing your database query.",0
8902,it has to work (if you didn't alter any browser settings).,0
8903,"however, the variable isn't available till the next load of the page.",0
8905,"if not, make 100% sure you're not outputting anything before you set the cookie.",0
8906,"concerning your second problem, session_destroy() destroys a session, but it doesn't invalidate cookies already sent to the client.",0
8907,you need to manually invalidate them by setting their expiration time.,0
8909,in order to receive a cookie from the browser it must be: set in php -> the browser should load -> the user should navigate to the next page (or submit a form).,0
8910,so basically if you use setcookie you can't read $_cookie yet until the next refresh.,0
8911,that's why the echo s weren't showing anything.,0
8912,they were showing null - to confirm this use var_dump and you'll see the output.,0
8914,"read the manual for details: http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php when inserting your text into the database, escape it properly for sql syntax once or, better, use prepared statements.",0
8915,see how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
8918,"your $con isn't set inside your function, so mysqli won't work.",0
8922,currently you'd need to look inside $_post['03'] if you selected mar,0
8924,"your code however, passes only one (and it doesn't match the var you are expecting to be in):",0
8925,"you are trying to send html from your php - header('content-type: text/html'); but you are telling your javascript to expect plaintext - datatype: 'text',",0
8929,"isset() is a, lets say little helping ""function"", you can check, it the field ""is set"", whether it is ""filled"" or not.and &amp;&amp; is a logical operator.",0
8930,"if you have another field and don't exactly now, what you are doing, then yes, just add &amp;&amp; and isset, but i can only give you an advice: learn php and try to understand it - it not hard.",0
8935,you will have to use additional methods like mysql_num_rows() or mysql_fetch_assoc() on the result reference returned by mysql_query() .,0
8936,be careful with potential sql injection .,0
8940,check orms like propel or doctine as well.,0
8941,"you can add limit 1 to your query to avoid useless processing, if your goal is to check only if at least one match is found in table crm given the party_id .",0
8944,on the last line in the script use the htmlentities function.,0
8945,"your submit a tag would not be included in the post data, so check for the existence of one of the input tags, say $_post['username']",0
8946,i have just tested your code.,0
8947,"you are checking if submit field/button is sent over the form, but you do not have anything named submit in your form.",0
8948,"you have got username and password, so changing your if(isset($_post['submit'])) to if(isset($_post['username'])) or if(isset($_post)) will fix your issue.",0
8951,if you will check and redirect on view page that will not redirect to your login controller even if you have unset session data.,0
8952,"i would store a session variable, something like $_session['countedpostid']=$post_id then, on refresh, check to make sure the $_get['postid'] is the same as $_session['countedpostid'] .",0
8953,"if yes, it's already been counted.",0
8955,"perhaps try storing an array of ""already-incremented"" post_id's in the sessions variable in order to prevent issues from going back/forward.",0
8959,some one in their infinite wisdom decided that when you sort you must want to sort the actual array but when you reverse you must want to save it to a new array variable.,0
8960,"those aren't arrays (they're strings), but you can handle the problem by splitting the string into an array and using php's filtering ( filter_var in this case):",0
8961,"you can estimate the correct answer based on your knowledge of your specific folder and web structure, but that is far from a general solution.",0
8962,"but i would recommend you to use a boostrap file that is the entry point for each ""page"".",0
8963,there you can setup you $basepath variable and other needed values.,0
8964,another thing you could do is inject the base path to your $_server array from apache (if that is what you are using.,0
8965,it would then be available to your entire application.,0
8966,regular expressions will probably be the most useful here.,0
8967,preg_match will help you with this.,0
8968,"per your comment, if the number you're trying to get has commas in it, you can use a different regular expression that will grab all characters until the first space",0
8971,"to answer your second question, if you try the following code:",0
8972,$_get is an array .. so you can just iterate over it using foreach,0
8973,you can also do extract($_get) to make all of them as variable .. but i wont suggest it.,0
8974,if you want to save it to db you should consider mysql_real_escape_string($value) .,0
8975,to print a html table .. do you want something like this ?,0
8977,or you can change the js part and provide the data element:,0
8978,"no need for json_decode , jquery already converts the data object into a urlencoded parameter string, which php in turn converts into an array.",0
8979,you need to check the return value of pdo::query() .,0
8980,in (ugly) php there are lots of functions that return a value of mixed type.,0
8982,therefore you are not guaranteed that the value returned is a pdostatement .,0
8983,in your case the query is invalid (by using a reserved keyword like from as a column name) which results in a return value of type boolean with the value false.,0
8984,a boolean value is not an object and therefore your call to $sth-&gt;setfetchmode() fails.,0
8985,"an exception (pdo::errmode_exception), so you don't need to check thereturn value a warning (pdo::errmode_warning) nothing (pdo::errmode_silent), so you have to check the return value, errorcode() and errorinfo()",0
8988,"you get an error because $result[$i] is not an array, and array_push expects an array as input.",0
8989,i got it to work with the following code:,0
8990,using this file everything in the url if it is not a valid directory or file is ignored and routed to index.php in the site root.,0
8991,"i then access it as a single paramater using $_server['request_uri'] which i can explode using explode(""/"", $_server['request_uri']) , this gives me an array starting at index 0 of each value.",0
8992,using this script i am still able to access $_get variables as long as at the end of the uri the convention ?var_name=value has been used.,0
8993,if you want to send the jquery object as string (html) to the server you should first extract the html from that object:,0
8994,"second (as already commented), inside php you should use $_post['mydata']; (the key should be the string mydata and not a constant).",0
8996,"before using pdo, i guess you were validating your data (using a validation filter for instance), and then you escaped it before inserting it in your db.",0
8997,"now, you only need (but still need) to do the first thing.",0
9000,"'null' is a string, if you want to compare to null value - use null .",0
9001,"i don't think that $ses_id in your db has value 'null' .checking if value is set can be done with isset , and with empty for not empty:",0
9003,"and also try to debug, does your if condition satisfied or not.",0
9004,in your case if your if condition does not satisfied then it is not possible your below code will execute.,0
9005,"if you take a look at your php code, you're basically doing nothing with the output of json_encode() ...",0
9006,now you should get the data you want as response.,0
9007,"edit: @1nsan3, you asked in the comment if echo not does the same as var_dump() ... i think you get an answer here: what&#39;s the difference between echo, print, and print_r in php?",0
9008,"the response of your ajax request is already parsed by jquery when using datatype : 'json' , as explained in http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax",0
9009,"because of the way how print_r works, it is silly to put it inside a loop, this will give you actual output and is error free :).",0
9010,first of all stop using the mysql_ and mysqli_ libraries.,0
9012,if you want to execute a loop you need to put all your logic in the same loop.,0
9013,if you want to do the inserts faster you can put them in a single insert statement using code like this: how to insert an array into a single mysql prepared statement w/ php and pdo,0
9020,htmlpurifier is of use where you want to allow the user to input limited html markup.,0
9022,"but do you really want the user to be able to input markup for all fields, including their name and e-mail address?",0
9023,should i be able to have the name “edw ard b oi ng j r”?,0
9024,are users going to have to enter &amp;amp; every time they want to use an ampersand?,0
9025,"a better approach is usually to accept plain text as it is, and then html-escape it at the point you insert it into an html page (eg with &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($value); ?&gt; ) so that the exact string entered by the user appears in the page.",0
9026,the fields where you deliberately allow markup (and so use htmlpurifier instead of htmlspecialchars) are typically very much exceptional cases.,0
9027,note that if you are injecting into other contexts you need different escaping functions: for example if you are injecting into a javascript string in a &lt;script&gt; block then you need js-string escaping and neither htmlspecialchars nor htmlpurifier will help you with that.,0
9028,you are mixing pdo with mysql and there are multiple syntax errors.,0
9029,your code should be like this:,0
9030,you should be checking whether the index s actually exists in the $_get array before attempting to use it.,0
9031,it may be beneficial (if you plan on adding more cases) to use a switch statement to make your code more readable.,0
9033,"this way, i check the _get array for the key to exist without triggering the warning.",0
9034,it's not a good idea to disable the warnings because a lot of times they are at least interesting to take a look.,0
9035,"the above code means: if $_post['sub'] is not an empty string, evaluate the statements below.",0
9038,"use print_r($_post); at the beginning of mail.php enable php debugging / error reporting: http://blog.flowl.info/2013/enable-display-php-errors/ if you have javascript we cannot see in your sample code, remove it for further testing",0
9039,the ckeditor changes your inputs in a way that they are not anymore labeled by name attributes or renders the form in any other invalid form (don't think that's the problem),0
9040,edit: i recall in the past finding a lot of these samples and analyzing a few and also found them to decrypt incorrectly.,0
9042,you select everything from store (* equals all fields).,0
9044,"you use the count, to limit.",0
9046,you should not use addslashes for escaping your values.,0
9047,"i am not sure what values are in your database, perhaps you could post some?",0
9048,"perhaps you need to perform strip slashes, since you probably save values with slashes in your database?",0
9049,also note that your code suffering from sql injection.,0
9050,either change addslashes to intval() or add quotes around $id in the query (otherwise escaping will make no sense),0
9051,first you need to check $_server['request_method'] output so best way to convert output in upper,0
9052,then you can check with submit button name also like,0
9053,also you can check all values of form which will be submitting by isset() or empty(),0
9054,"i think, there may be a way to be sure the form was submitted using your form.",0
9057,what i've changed here is $conn-&gt;query($query); to $query-&gt;execute() .,0
9058,"because you're working with prepared statements, you need to call execute method of the object instance of prepared statement $query .",0
9059,set this attribute as soon as you created the pdo object instance.,0
9060,you can also set this attribute during the object instantiation through constructor like:,0
9061,i have found where the problem is on your function.,0
9062,"the problem is here : values (:customer_mail_adres, :naam, :paypal, :subscription_start, null, :password, :country_name)"");",0
9063,i'm not sure what datatype is subscription_end but i guess it should be date.,0
9065,also don't rush to reload the next page after running your query atleast but some delay on your header() so that you can print success message and see if its displaying then load next page,0
9067,they're not stored as a carriage return or new line character but the slash character followed by the letter.,0
9068,"when you're calling nl2br() , it's looking for the new line character, not the textual representation of it.",0
9069,you could use a regular expression ( preg_replace ) or str_replace to replace them.,0
9070,but the problem probably is caused by how the data is inserted in your database.,0
9071,the object of pdo is that you don’t have to escape anything; you just send it as data.,0
9072,technically there is pdo::quote() but it is rarely ever used and it is not exactly the equivalent to mysql_real_escape_string(),0
9074,"and, now assuming the connection is established, you can execute your query like this.",0
9075,"now, as you can probably tell, i haven't used anything to escape/sanitize the value of $_post[""color ""] .",0
9078,"last but not least, there are moments when you should not trust pdo 100%, and will be bound to take some extra measures to prevent sql injection, one of those cases is, if you are using an outdated versions of mysql [ mysql =&lt; 5.3.6 ] as described in this answer",0
9080,is the equivalent of $v = $this-&gt;db-&gt;quote($v); be sure you have a pdo instance in $this-&gt;db so you can call the pdo method quote(),0
9081,the array_filter function loops through the array and passes the value into a callback.,0
9083,"after all items are passed in the callback, the result array is returned.",0
9084,"oh, you just want to know if .txt is in the array.",0
9085,the quickest way to achieve what you want would be to just use fastroute .,0
9087,"i will assume that what you are actually makingis a proper website, but with pretty urls.",0
9088,"first you would have to implement a routing mechanism, which takes a list of regexp patterns, matches them agains your provided url (which you could be extraction from $_get['url'] or maybe $_server[request_uri] (your code actually wouldn't care from where the url was gathered ... you shouldn't be accessing superglobals inside functions/classes).",0
9089,"if you decide to have the human-readable notations, then there are two major directions:",0
9090,"as for ""how the end result might look like"", you can probably look at the code sample here .",0
9091,that would illustrate one of the available option for the router's public interface.,0
9094,for example i have the url doglist.html/?seller=29 i need to embed pagination with this pagination.,0
9095,so that the result will be like dog/list/3?breed=&amp;gender=female&amp;state=&amp;submit2=fetch i have solve this issue with this line of code $config['suffix'] = '?,0
9096,"'.http_build_query($_get, '', ""&amp;""); now my pagination with variables works fine.",0
9097,(i'm surprised not to find this referred to in the official documentation; think i'll need to write a patch to improve that.),0
9098,"if you wanted to be able to swallow exceptions and keep on using the transaction, you must create a savepoint before each statement that might fail.",0
9099,"if it fails, you must rollback to savepoint ...; .",0
9101,"this imposes extra overhead on the database for transaction management, adds round-trips, and burns through transaction ids faster (which means postgresql has to do more background cleanup work).",0
9102,"so: where possible, instead of swallowing an exception, run failure-prone database code in a retry loop.",0
9103,"make sure your code keeps a record of the information it needs to retry the whole transaction on error, not just the most recent statement.",0
9105,"if you do print_r($stored_hash_); , currently it will return something similar to this:",0
9107,"so if you set the your header location to that address, it should send the user back to the previous page",0
9108,"although be warned that $_server['http_referer'] may be empty, you should check for this first and if it is empty send them elsewhere, like your homepage.",0
9114,hope that this helps you get on route.,0
9115,i would recommend that you learn about debugging using xdebug so that way you can analyse better where you're failing.,0
9116,you can simply add a hidden input to your form containing the value of $thought_id :,0
9117,"then when the form is submitted, you can access the value of thought_id using $_post for your query (also cleaned it up a bit):",0
9118,here php is server-side execution and javascript is client side execution.,0
9119,and $_session is a server-side construct.so probably you can not access that directly using javascript you would need to store that variable in $_cookie to be able to access it client-side.,0
9120,"after this first replace, you can use str_replace() for all the other ++ to replace with ""he"".",0
9121,later edit:i checked and i saw that str_replace() has a limit parameter so you could use it too instead of preg_replace() .,0
9122,the relevant part of the code then looks like this:,0
9123,"without using intval() i also received the error syntax error or access violation: 1064 you have an error in your sql syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your mysql server version for the right syntax to use near ''0', 10' at line 1",0
9125,"in your case, it seems a post is more appropriate (reply).",0
9126,if you're going to be able to access it with :,0
9128,since you are taking your posted value as $_post['new_option'] ..you need to pass the data object as new_option in ajax...,0
9129,a cleaner way to achieve what you want is to use arrays instead of $this .,0
9130,you will have all the info you need and nothing more.,0
9131,there is a lot of stuff in your $this object than you don't need.,0
9132,a good practice is also to use the input class of codeigniter when you get your $_post variables.,0
9133,note you are vulnerable to sql injection.,0
9134,"since you are using mysqli, you may wish to consider using mysqli prepared statements .",0
9136,it opens up your system to sql injection .,0
9137,"while it's unlikely that someone could compromise your site when only insert statements are exposed in this way, it does mean that:",0
9138,anyone with an apostrophe in their name will break the logic of the request you are exposing a method by which someone can carry out a stored xss attack by submitting javascript to your guestbook,0
9139,"regarding the sql injection problem, there are 2 methods to protect your system - one is to transform the data in which a way that it cannot break the sql string it is added to (e.g.",0
9141,here you compose your sql command with placeholders for the data and substitute them at run time.,0
9143,your next problem is how to communicate this securely to the page where the user submits their guestbook comment (in your example code you try to do both operations in the same page).,0
9144,"sending it in a round trip to the browser, as a cookie or as form variable means that it could be tampered with.",0
9146,"when you receive the post containing the guestbook data, then you should use an update user set guestbook=:gstbk where id=:id_from_session (or you could insert it into a seperate table with id as a foreign key )",0
9147,"lastly, when you output the message the person left in your guestbook, make sure you protect the browser from any nasties in there:",0
9148,you can use regex101.com to easily test your regex statement.,0
9150,"you haven't posted any code, so it's difficult to say where exactly you're going wrong, however, here is a simple example that works for the values you posted:",0
9151,"as an aside, i don't really think you want to use htmlspecialchars() when dynamically generating javascript code.",0
9153,"now that i see the code you've posted, i believe you can resolve your syntax error by single-quoting the rendered json string in the javascript context.",0
9159,"if you just want to add an item to the $concate array, $concate[] = $orgnisation_name; is enough.",0
9160,do note that this work only if the string formatting for each piece of data is consistent.,0
9161,"your last item is an array, so you have to iterate through it to retrieve its values.",0
9163,in your code dont use $_post directly.,0
9165,use a function like mysql_real_escape_string or other functions available (another topic for discussion),0
9166,"to answer your question, you would need an active database present in your server (prefereably mysql my fav :p).",0
9167,you can follow the tutorial here or here to insert values before mailing to the user his details.,0
9169,"then, you have no $_post['drowpdown'] whatsoever, so your isset() would never evaluate to true.",0
9170,"if you meant to refer to the dropdown html input field, you're on the wrong track.",0
9174,here we simply use usort() to use our own custom compare function.,0
9175,"in this function we first explode() the time by a dot, so we get the time and the milliseconds separately.",0
9176,"after this we convert the time into a timestamp with strtotime() and multiply it by 1,000 so we can add the milliseconds to it.",0
9177,"you need to install a postgres driver/module, as mysqli is the driver for mysql.",0
9178,"or if the package is installed, you need to enable de module in php.ini",0
9179,i guess your code is in a class which uses the namespace website\magento so you have to tell php that you want to use the class mysqli from the root-namespace.,0
9180,"but this is just plain php and has nothing to do with pimcore ;-) please have a look at the following link, it describes in detail how to work with namespaces in php: http://php.net/namespaces",0
9181,i think it's because of your quotes around the set of integers.,0
9182,moreover it is possible you have a typo on your limit syntax.,0
9183,"let's use the standard limit :limit offset :offset synthax, more readable and compatible with every database.",0
9184,"check out parse_url() , which can do the split you want.",0
9185,you might want to do a substr to get rid of the www.,0
9186,"this can be manipulated by attackers in certain circumstances, so make sure you escape it with htmlentities($domain, ent_quotes); when you echo it to the page.",0
9187,in the example you link to the author suggests doing this:,0
9189,but the form is then processed below that.,0
9191,instead that chunk of code needs to be with your html form page.,0
9193,and then the session_start(); allows your php to pick up the value of $_session['form_secret'] &amp; act on it.,0
9195,after that you can use the variable to unset the session.,0
9196,and your php code which catch the remove event to something like this:,0
9197,"$f and $h are not being set you are inserting into (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,g,i,j,k) .",0
9198,"you don't escape your input, making an apostrophe ' in any of the fields break your code.",0
9199,"use mysql_real_escape_string() ... or better yet, don't use mysql_ functions at all, but rather use mysqli_ functions or pdo functions.",0
9200,uploading too many files will hit the max post value set for php and/or webserver.,0
9201,(check the values in php.ini and httpd.conf if you are using apache.),0
9208,or a sufficient replace ( preg_replace ).,0
9210,if you can post the page you can get it from $_post array other wise you have to pass in url like http://test.com?photo_id = $_get['photo_id']; using php header function,0
9211,mysql queries are not case sensitive by default.,0
9212,you can set a column to be case sensitive by manipulating its collation to be case sensitive or case insensitive.,0
9213,"but you may not wish to have case sensitivity baked into the column itself (unless you need that for indexing purposes, see below).",0
9214,"in order to run a case sensitive query, you need to use the binary keyword to cast your column appropriately:",0
9216,"if instead you just want to create an exception scenario, or ignore the change, you could instead create a unique index on your column - for your situation you'll need to make sure that it's case sensitive.",0
9218,"the ignore is optional, that's why it's in brackets.",0
9219,"that will update the column if it does not violate the unique index, it will give you a mysql error if it does violate the unique index and you omit ignore , and it will silently have no effect if it violates the unique index and you use ignore .",0
9220,"... and that would probably be what you're looking for, or you could use the query modifications above to not even receive a matching result if the case doesn't match.",0
9222,"but for me, the check if(isset($_post['submitbtn'])) fails in both ie8 and ff4; it worked fine in chrome12.",0
9223,"and the reason is that when you are using an &lt;input type=""image""&gt; kind of button to submit the form, you need to check it like this:",0
9224,and that check will work on all browsers.,0
9226,update: the alternate response on this page using http_build_query is better because it lets you add new variables to the query string without worrying about extraneous ?s and such.,0
9228,so you can access them directly as variables.,0
9229,there are definitely different gotchas depending on which database you are using.,0
9230,"if portability is a concern, i'd not rely on some of what might be mysql idiosyncrasies that you seem to be finding, above.",0
9232,"that doesn't mean that you're assuming the kinds of changes it will have hoisted upon it at some point in the future, but rather that some form of change will be made.",0
9235,what if i want it to close and reopen itself every 5th time it was used.,0
9236,what if i decide that in the interest of scaling my app i want to use a pool of 10 connections?,0
9237,or a configurable number of connections?,0
9238,"then, in 6 months when your app is super famous and getting dugg and slashdotted and you decide you need more than a single connection, all you have to do is implement some pooling in the getconnection() method.",0
9239,"or if you decide that you want a wrapper that implements sql logging, you can pass a pdo subclass.",0
9240,"or if you decide you want a new connection on every invocation, you can do do that.",0
9241,"array_search('68315163', $data) doesn't return anything useful because the value you're searching for is not in the array.",0
9242,you should use some mvc framework like yii2 for your application to get a clearer separation of concerns here.,0
9245,"lets assume you have a formular with has the fields amount, note, price for example.",0
9246,"testsave.php references $_post['canvasdata'] , but the js sends the intended variable as imgbase64.",0
9247,that line should instead read $img = $_post['imgbase64'] in order to match the ajax.,0
9249,first you need to find out which statement fails by checking their return values (always read about every command you use in the php manual first).,0
9250,update: and if you want to deal with exceptions (as pekka suggested): how to squeeze error message out of pdo?,0
9251,i believe you are using print_r() in backend php code:,0
9252,when you are using datatype in ajax try this in backend:,0
9253,it's because $lang_result is an array that has array elements.,0
9254,"i'd suggest you do foreach on $lang_result (or even better for , so you get a counter right away) and then use array_search to find if there is a match, and then mark that element using a counter.",0
9255,"also, isset accepts more than one parameter, so you could use it like this:",0
9256,"no, you need to use the mysql function unix_timestamp as described here",0
9260,this will send all the form fields in the post request with your ajax call.,0
9261,"if this is not working, please try to var_dump($_post) to make sure what you are getting.",0
9263,in your case make id field auto increment in the database and make a query without it:,0
9266,"the only thing that links a user to its specific piece of session data is the cookie with the session id, which can manually be changed.",0
9267,"if you have a lot of active sessions, they might guess a valid session id and hijack someone else's session.",0
9268,"i am using php json_decode for ease of use and using print_r to demo, you could use a foreach loop to print it out properly",0
9269,"if you want multiple images on one page, you should use this php file to produce one image, and then use the php file as the source in an html image tag, like this:",0
9270,"when getting the filename via $_get , it would be a good idea to watch out for unexpected characters, especially slashes.",0
9271,"someone could call the url like this: picture.php?filename=../badimage.jpg , which may display a file in a different folder than you want them to have access to.",0
9272,"so perhaps do something like $_get[""filename""] = stripslashes($_get[""filename""]); or something.",0
9273,"placeholders, you can pass each value to be bounded as the values of an array (see example #3 from the manual ).",0
9274,"now, since you are using implode , $values will be a single string, something like",0
9276,"since you didn't provide the same amount of values (1) as you have placeholders (5), you end up with",0
9277,you should note that there're two completely different php extensions designed to connect to oracle databases:,0
9278,oci8 is the extension developed by oracle corporation.,0
9279,it's actively maintained and it's the recommended way to interact with oracle.,0
9280,pdo_oci is the pdo driver developed by the community.,0
9281,it was never finished and it's actually kind of abandoned (thus the experimental warning displayed in the documentation).,0
9282,both contain the oci (oracle call interface) term because both make use internally of the oci api provided by oracle.,0
9283,"as such, you need the oracle instant client no matter what library you choose.",0
9284,but you then need to install the corresponding php packages.,0
9285,"in your case, you're installing oci8 and then trying to run pdo code.",0
9286,"if you're having trouble getting the php_pdo_oci library installed either via pecl or via compiling from source, this pdooci class on github may be able to help.",0
9287,the only difference is the way you instantiate your pdo object.,0
9288,the rest should work exactly the same as if you were using a pdo object.,0
9289,"if you want to echo the xml, do echo htmlspecialchars($xml_string) but don't store it in the variable.",0
9290,"but you are missing the xml declaration, at the beginning of the string:",0
9292,i would recommend simply iterating the array and comparing the keys:,0
9294,"there are a number of ways to do this, the best really depends on the rest of your code.",0
9295,"my personal preference for linear navigation like this is to store pages the user visits in an array in a session, e.g.",0
9297,"from your newly posted code, there is a closing &lt;/b&gt; but no opening tag.",0
9298,"as for unsetting to revert back to a step, you'd be best to do something like this:",0
9299,"this is a simplified version of how cookies work, but it's basically accurate.since you're unsetting the cookie on the server, you have to request the page again to be given the new http headers that don't contain the old cookie information.",0
9300,that's what the reload would do.,0
9301,"the output of var_dump or print_r is readable - the problem is the html output, which removes line-breaks.",0
9302,so i suggest to use this functions inside a pre-tag,0
9304,"so, the size of the column "" wochentag "" is 2, and that was the problem.",0
9305,"so, the only thing i had to change was the size of the wochentag column from 2 to 3 and the code runs.",0
9306,"i'm not sure what your place_holder variable contains, but i think this might be the reason.",0
9307,join is just another name for the implode function which returns a string.,0
9308,execute needs the actual physical input item.,0
9309,from the php site on execute for the array of input values:,0
9310,"as stated in comments, here is a function that will execute a sql string using the given data object.",0
9311,"it would be best to separate this out into a couple of functions (create parameter array, bind parameters, ect), but i have put them all into one function for readability.",0
9312,"php does have the concept of variable variables , so you can do this:",0
9314,you can use the variable variable syntax to get the value of your object variables corresponding to the attributes this way:,0
9315,notice the $key after -&gt; .,0
9316,normally object variable syntax does not have a $ in that place.,0
9317,"by using a $ there, i'm telling it to get the value of the object variable whose name is the value of $key .",0
9318,this produces a single string with values separated by commas.,0
9319,"it doesn't matter if you wrap it in array($result) , that just creates an array of a single string, even though the single string contains commas.",0
9320,"instead, you need to pass to execute() is an array with the same number of elements as the number of ?",0
9322,another option is to use __dir__ or dirname(__file__) depending on the php version you are using.,0
9323,either of those two ways will return the folder name where the file that is executed by php resides in.,0
9324,"the implementation is similar to the above, the only difference is that you are trying to figure out which file it is accessed, instead of which uri was requested (better practice and more secure).",0
9326,"now you want to compare the, just use the last part to compare!!",0
9327,"to get the completer url, you can use below code (without any tags stripped or without worrying about http/https protocol) :",0
9351,(here i go through every element of the array with array_map() .,0
9352,then i return each element with 999 at the start plus the original value with an offset of 1 which i get with substr() ),0
9353,you need to call your functions if you define them.,0
9354,not doing so is like building a room within a new house but forgetting the door.,0
9357,you should at least do a basic validation of the data to see if they are correct!,0
9358,"first of all before writing a solution and tell to much, it is always a good practice to make step by step code troubleshooting.",0
9359,"i removed the if statement and a lot and just focused to see if i get some thing returned, i did not .",0
9360,"and if you want to check your code returning some thing or not, use var_dump($somevariable) .",0
9361,"last thing, before making a post form, you could create a dummy username and password in your database and inject that directly in your code like, just to see if every thing is working, and then move to your form:",0
9362,"the solution i did is just to demonstrate how to do it and not necessarily representation of the best logic, but it is up to you to find the correct logic and all depends on your strategy.",0
9363,you can get the value of the radiobutton by using following code:,0
9364,now you can do a simple check in your backend:,0
9365,when you want to get the value of a radiobutton and the names are the same(when you have multiple radiobuttons) you can get the value by using $_post['name of radiobutton'],0
9366,"sessions and cookies are domain dependent, it is a browser security issue.",0
9367,"however, there is a ""trick"" you can try, even though it is a bit more complex:",0
9368,"authenticate the user, emit a jwt code and create a key=>value type of record in a shared storage (database most likely).",0
9369,"the key should be unique, the value should be jwt code and also set an expire time of 20-30 seconds.",0
9372,so you need to fool it with something like:,0
9373,"you could pass the jwt directly, but passing a key that expires fast should be more secure.",0
9374,add an image for every domain.,0
9375,instead of a cookie you can create a session on each domain.,0
9378,"there's plenty of information around regarding prepared, parametrized statements if you're interested (which you should be).",0
9379,these would be a good start,0
9380,"you'll want to do the same in your select query, eg",0
9381,i don't know if this is your problem (don't know how much you know about php so just saying).,0
9383,"looking at this code, firstly i can see $result =mysqli-&gt;query() the $result here is a mysqli object and cannot be compared with the constant.",0
9384,please get the values of the object first then do the comparative.,0
9385,the problem is that the key mail_subscribe will exist in $_post only when the checkbox is checked.,0
9386,"that being said, xpath will accept html entities in the place of their literal values, so if you run your variable through htmlspecialchars($var, ent_quotes) you will be safe.",0
9387,"it is written by me, and how to work with it is similar to the pdo wrapper.",0
9388,you are prematurely ending the string to be echo ed by using double quotes within the string.,0
9389,"one way of fixing this would be to use only single quotes within your double quotes, like:",0
9391,you can enable them by setting the following at the top of your script:,0
9393,you are concatenating the value of $_session['classid'] .,0
9395,change your code to something like this:,0
9397,"if $_session['classid'] is a different type, you should change the placeholder accordingly.",0
9398,see the bind_param documentation for more details on that.,0
9399,"$_session is managed by php, sessionstorage is managed by the browser.",0
9400,"if you want to do this, you have to pass instructions to javascript in the document, like this:",0
9401,preg_match stops looking after the first match.,0
9402,"preg_match_all , on the other hand, continues to look until it finishes processing the entire string.",0
9403,"once match is found, it uses the remainder of the string to try and apply another match.",0
9405,the preg_match_all function searches for all the matches in a string and outputs them in a multi-dimensional array ( $matches ) ordered according to $flags .,0
9406,"when no $flags value is passed, it orders results so that $matches[0] is an array of full pattern matches, $matches[1] is an array of strings matched by the first parenthesized sub-pattern, and so on.",0
9408,this approach is vulnerable to sql injection attacks.,0
9409,"javascript arrays must be defined first by using var variablename = new array(); , otherwise they will function as if they are standard variables.",0
9410,so it is best to avoid the hassle of setting and handling them if they are not needed.,0
9411,"if you really want to use preg_match (even though i recommend strpos , like on xeoncross' answer), use this:",0
9412,"your missing an closing tag for the values, and from is preserved, so you should escape it... (use quotes around it should do the trick,...:",0
9414,there is a missing parenthesis at the end of your generated query.,0
9415,"from and date are reserved keywords, enclose them in `.",0
9416,"seen and toid are not varchar fields, and therefore their values shouldn't be enclosed in ' .",0
9417,warning : this is vulnerable to sql injections.,0
9419,prepared statements will help avoiding them.,0
9420,i believe the function you're trying to use would be mysqli_stmt::free_result() .,0
9421,you'll need to change this line:,0
9422,"the second uncaught exception occurs because mysqli is an unbuffered sql query handler, so you should store your results if you're looping simultaneous executions with something like $stmt-&gt;store_result(); and then you can unload the mysqli buffer to state a new query.",0
9423,"if you just want to find the row, you don't need to explode in php.you can use find_in_set",0
9424,"those values are telling pdo how to treat the input, not to disallow input.",0
9426,"it won't tell you ""you entered abcd but expected value was integer"".",0
9427,you must do this check on your own before passing data to pdo .,0
9429,this is intended for when you invoke stored procedures and variable is supposed to be modified based on procedure's output.,0
9430,"if you tried to do the following with bindparam , it wouldn't work and you'd get an error:",0
9433,you are rolling back your changes every time by calling $pdo-&gt;rollback(); at the end of your script.,0
9434,you should only call $pdo-&gt;rollback(); in your catch block and remove the $pdo-&gt;rollback(); and the end of your script.,0
9435,your code is working with myisam tables because the myisam engine does not support transactions so that $pdo-&gt;rollback(); has no effect.,0
9440,has a parentheses missing at the end and a missing opening brace.,0
9441,"has a missing semi-colon at the end, should read as:",0
9442,this occurs before garbage collection is even thought of.,0
9443,"so there you have it, unset() does actually help you out during the lifecycle of your app.",0
9446,"i realize this line was commented out, but if you are running such a query, i would suggest indexing metadata.memberid to avoid scanning each document in the fs.files collection.",0
9447,"you may be able utilize multi-part http responses to send back multiple images, but browser support could be problematic (see: this question from a few years back ).",0
9448,"in your getphoto.php source, you're intending to call mongogridfs::findone() with a string parameter.",0
9449,you should be aware that users could exploit the query string so that $_request['filename'] is actually an array (see: this post on the subject ).,0
9450,you would do well to check the request parameter and/or cast it to a string before passing it to findone() .,0
9451,"this is going to query on the filename field, so you should make sure that it's indexed.",0
9452,"per the fs.files specification , the filename field is optional and not necessarily unique.",0
9455,my previous points on validating the request parameter would still stand in this case -- it would allow you to use the default _id index.,0
9456,"the difference between foreach and array_keys in terms of speed will be so negligible that you will have to run a big scale test to even figure out the difference, just that the array_keys way looks more neat (subjective).",0
9457,"premature optimization is the root of all evil if you want to test which of the two approaches is the fastest, write two scripts, run them a couple of thousand times, and compare the average time taken array_keys does not use foreach as such, but array_keys , internally, iterates over the elements of the array in exactly the same way as foreach does php arrays are hash tables, their implementation is well documented: here, for example .",0
9458,"how a basic array iteration works is explained with c examples, read through it, then look at php's source and find the array_keys implementation if you want to be absolutely, sure",0
9460,"also note that, depending on your php version (and cached op codes), the benchmark scripts might produce different results entirely",0
9461,"performance wise they are pretty much the same you can't really measure a difference, so simply put: premature optimization is the root of all evil .",0
9462,"use whichever piece of code is most reliable and easiest to maintain, document and explain.",0
9464,so from performance view there is no real difference between both methods.,0
9465,"but if you look at both scripts you will see that with the foreach loop you kinda write more code and also a ""useless"" loop, you can also see this that the method with the foreach loop then generates more opcode and makes almost double the amount of operations as the method with the array_keys() :",0
9466,also as pointed out in the comments from @eliasvanootegem it's not always a bad thing if a code generates more opcode to makes this clear here!,0
9467,"array_keys() doesn't use directly a foreach or for loop, but it also loops through the array.",0
9469,"if you echo that into your browser, you have to use view-source to view it or you need to encode it to html first:",0
9471,i think the the problem is in the variable name.,0
9472,"and by the way, if you assign a custom click handler to a html link, it's better to call event.preventdefault() as a first thing in handler, because otherwise browser will try to follow the href attribute of this link, in your case - scrolling page up to top.",0
9474,i see you using $_session[custno] before it's called.,0
9475,that's why your textbox is empty.,0
9477,simple solution: use multiple api calls.,0
9478,"one to set @n=0 , then a separate api call to execute the select query.",0
9479,"as long as you use the same connection to mysql, the value of @n stays alive in the session.",0
9481,"when using pdo::fetch_bound with fetch() , the method will not return a result record.",0
9482,instead the value of the column should be available in the variable you have bound using $stmt-&gt;bindcolumn() earlier.,0
9483,however you won't need that bindcolumn() call.,0
9484,you could simplify the code as this:,0
9485,there is too much code in your class.,0
9486,"to send a distinct query to get just one property from database, creating a distinct connection for this is a dead overkill.",0
9487,connection have to be moved away unconditionally and you must think of getting all user data with one query.,0
9488,"better go with foreach( $_post['checkbox'] as $k =&gt; $v) , it may not always be numbers and even if this way you do not have a loop for each possible in range but only for each selected checkbox.",0
9490,i got this to work and figured i'd post the results for everyone who might need them in the future.,0
9491,i realized that i know what the keys are and that i can use them in the implosion process.,0
9493,see also the documentation for mysqli::use-result .,0
9495,"check your parameter, before executing these function, execute thesefunctions only if the parameter is array.",0
9496,"check your parameter, if it is null or non-array make it array.",0
9497,"i recommend you the second solution, because even if the array is null it will not affect the other functionality.",0
9499,"you can't use like '%something%', '%somethingelse%' , that syntax is not valid.",0
9500,you need to use the or keyword to list your filtering possibilities.,0
9501,"no, you have to instantiate a new mysqli object.",0
9502,you can use the same variable $mysqli though but you have to write this code again:,0
9503,"although it is not in the documentation, mysqli::connect() is a method, and you can use it to ""reconnect"" your object -appears to just be an alias for the constructor.",0
9504,if your login process set a $_session option you can check this.,0
9507,all that matters in this equation is that the value of the $_get string is always sanitized before being passed to the database.,0
9508,"in your case user_id seems to always be an integer, so for you it's as simple as:",0
9509,"meanwhile if using prepared statements, you can just pass the value along and rest easily.",0
9510,"in this way, we allow the mysqli driver to handle the sanitizing of the data for us, as we've told it that the bound parameter $_get['user_id'] must be an integer as well.",0
9512,i would recommend that you use pdo.,0
9513,"if you already know about pdo, this would be how you'd make sure you get 'single' result set.",0
9516,"i think the problem could be the connection, everything else looks fine, i dont think you can access a mysqli object with normal mysql_conn..",0
9517,"also, don't change to mysql, it is far too old now!",0
9520,"if you want to pass an array, do it with:",0
9521,"if $result is an empty data set, this error is triggered.check if the number of rows returned is >0 before doing this.",0
9522,mysql_num_rows is what you should use to check rows returned before trying to put it into an array.,0
9524,"you're checking $_post['search'] , so the name of your text element field should be changed to search.",0
9525,if you run php in the way you do.,0
9526,but not actually posting the form.,0
9527,you will have to submit the form through a browser to populate the $_post vars,0
9528,you can have both the php driver produced by microsoft and pdo.,0
9530,you can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=80e44913-24b4-4113-8807-caae6cf2ca05 .,0
9532,"(and you should escape the $_post[] columns, too.",0
9533,your form input's name attributes need to match your database table's columns.,0
9536,you will have to tweak it according to your needs and you have to check if the post/get not empty as well.,0
9537,i prefer to use post request for login so this example will use post request..,0
9538,this is how to create the user.,0
9541,"i'm guessing that $_session[$attachment] contains the name of your generated pdf file, so what you are doing here is attaching the name of the file as an attachment, rather than the file itself.",0
9542,you should probably be using this instead:,0
9543,"mysqli_stmt_bind_result() tells mysqli which variable you want to be populate when you fetch a row, but it doesn't fetch() anything yet.",0
9544,"this is necessary to call once, before you call fetch.",0
9545,"mysqli_stmt_store_result() sets an optional behavior so that the client downloads all rows when you fetch() the first row, and caches the whole result set in the client (i.e.",0
9546,subsequent fetch() calls will simply iterate over this client-cached result set.,0
9547,but setting this option itself does not cause a fetch() yet either.,0
9548,"the reason for that is because you haven't submitted the form yet, but you are already trying to define variables based on $_post values.",0
9549,you need to check if the values are set first:,0
9550,"while your page is load at the time your $_post data is not set, so that it will not render the keys that you mentioned.",0
9551,use any of the following solution:,0
9554,"this is the reason why it works if you put it into a separate file, but it would still give you the same notices if you open up the target url for the form directly (bypassing the form).",0
9555,"note that even if stuff have been posted to the server, it doesn't mean that all of the data you expect will be there.",0
9556,"some times normal functions of the browsers mean that they won't send some fields (unchecked checkboxes etc), and other times it's the user trying to do something you don't want them doing.",0
9557,this is why it's important to also check each and every value.,0
9558,"not only if it exists, but also if it is within an acceptable range of input values/patterns.",0
9559,"this last bit is called input validation, and is normally done with the filter_var() function and its bretheren .",0
9562,"the error handling should be done a bit more graceful, with detailed explanations to the user about what failed and what's required/permitted in these fields.",0
9564,also don't use htmlentities i suggest you to use htmlpurifer to santize inputs from malicious inputs.,0
9566,third way is a most efficient because in this case php sees single quotes and do not spend resources to analyse string.,0
9567,"strictly answering your question with the information you provided: if you're falling under else clause, it obviously means your if clause wasn't fulfilled.",0
9568,"in your case, $author_output &lt;= 0 , which lead us to believe 1) your query is returning no results and therefore you must review your table contents, select parameters and etc or 2) your query is returning error and you're not dealing with it as you should.",0
9569,use php sessions instead of cookies.,0
9570,php will automatically handle the session management.,0
9571,you can also overload its functionality if you want more control.,0
9572,"with php-sessions, only a session identifier is stored in the browser cookies.",0
9573,"you can store any information in the superglobal variable $_session , and the browser will not be able to see or tamper with these variables.",0
9575,this is to make sure that nobody hijacked the session id and is pretending to be logged in from another location.,0
9576,not sure why you need explode here.,0
9577,you can find the position of the last period using the strrpos function and get everything after that pos:,0
9578,there are no difference for any sensible amount of data.,0
9579,that's not a thing you have to be concerned too much of.,0
9580,just use whatever you like more - for readability or other subjective reasons,0
9581,"whenever your page is opened, you check if there's set cookie_name cookie through isset($_cookie[$cookie_name]) .",0
9582,"if isset returns false, you set a cookie through setcookie(cookie_name, value, expire); , maybe setting expire time to 24h (you have to set it in seconds, so 24h is 84600).",0
9583,"also, you trigger your counting systems with a +1 to your visitor counter.",0
9584,you also have a authentication bypass issue because you don't exit() after the redirect.,0
9586,"as @jim pointed out, you are calling session_destroy, why?",0
9588,use if ($_server['request_method'] == 'post') .,0
9589,what if you rename the submit button?,0
9590,if(isset($_post['submit'])) checks if the variable exists or in this case if the key exists under the array and is not null.,0
9591,if($_post['submit']) will check if the value of $_post['submit'] is equal to true (or some other value that evaluates to true).,0
9594,"if they're related to the html code you've got name=""a' .",0
9596,"then instead of having post variables named a1_post and a2_post , etc, you will have ones named a_post[1] and a_post[2] etc.",0
9597,it then becomes very easy to loop through them because they're an array.,0
9598,you can access any $_get values by using this code $_get['sub1'] which will return sub-1,0
9599,"if you are using php, add [] to the input names, and you'll receive an array of values.",0
9601,you've used var_dump($reals + $dummy); which means: take $reals which consists of 1 item (today as the first and the only element) and append everything from $dummy that has another keys.,0
9603,it's also more descriptive than timestamps.,0
9604,you could use dateperiod to easily create the keys.,0
9605,"if you are looking for an optimal solution, i would do something like this:",0
9609,anything set to $segments will appear in the url.,0
9610,so this $segments[] = $query['view']; adds the view to the url.,0
9611,"since your parser automatically sets the view, still unset the view in the build function, but don't push it into $segments :",0
9612,"naturally, you may have to adjust your parser, since now the number of segments will be different, so you will need different index values.",0
9614,"when you load it in the beginning you click on the button named ""test"" and so you have a $_post['test'] value when you load the next time.",0
9615,once again your logic at the top of index.php is this:,0
9618,"nl2br() will not replace the newlines, but will additionally put in the &lt;br /&gt; .",0
9619,"so you need to simply remove the &lt;br /&gt; , not replace it with a newline: str_replace('&lt;br /&gt;','',""$abme"");",0
9620,"since $s2 is an array i think you want to use in_array() function, cause strstr() is font string only, not array",0
9621,"i think you can var_dump($_files) to see,and check you html form is have enctype=""multipart/form-data""",0
9623,you should consider using at least simplexml if you don't want to use db.,0
9624,this is essentially example 1 here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-multisort.php but our $ar2 is an array of arrays instead of an array of single values.,0
9625,also if you need more control over the sort you'll see examples of options you can use at that url: just add them to the list of arguments for array_multisort .,0
9627,if i caught one of my colleagues writing code like this i would give them a week to improve themselves or have them fired.,0
9629,"if anything, i would advise you to adopt a more robust programming style.",0
9633,abstract away anything to do with sessions.,0
9634,"don't check the session variables yourself, write a class that does it for you.",0
9637,just join the two tables in one select on userid and query using parameter you're providing.also i can see useridparam in your stored procedure but can't see it used in your code.,0
9638,"anyway, remember to prevent yourself from sql injection .stored procedures don't always protect you from such: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brian_swan/archive/2011/02/16/do-stored-procedures-protect-against-sql-injection.aspx",0
9639,"this isn't really an answer to your question directly, but it's worth pointing out because it's an extremely serious security issue.",0
9640,the way you are constructing your queries opens you up to sql injection .,0
9641,"the reason is that you are directly interpolating user-provided input (in this case, title ) directly into a database query.",0
9642,"someone could use that to interpolate and execute their own, malicious sql within your query.",0
9644,"notice how i have removed the variable $title from the query itself, and i am instead binding it to a placeholder :title inside a prepared statement .",0
9645,"now, php will construct the actual ""code"" portion of the query separately, an introduce the variable :title later.",0
9648,you pass it the array you want part of and the position you want to start it (minus one since arrays are zero-based keys).,0
9650,this will help prevent xss attacks.,0
9652,this will protect you from sql injection attacks.,0
9653,only use variables that exist -- which is what you should probably do.,0
9655,"in a case such as the one you presented, for a variable that's used lots of times, i would make sure it exists, and, if not, set it to '', for instance, at the beginning of my script.",0
9656,"that's not really looking great, but it'll work -- and, this way, you won't have to go through your whole application, patching everything.",0
9658,"according to your code, you should use $_session['usr_permission'] instead of $_session['permission']",0
9659,you should be running your $_get['tutorialblock'] against a whitelist.,0
9660,here is an example for you.,0
9661,"the above is only pseudo code (example), you still need to ensure user input is vaid.",0
9662,you can store in $_session a value that represents the user's home.,0
9663,"if a user is outside his home directory, he will be redirected into his home.",0
9665,"i have tried again to edit your code, you don't need to use global variable, because you instantiate the pdo class directly and use it on the fly.",0
9667,so you should not test if it is set with &lt;?php if (isset($_session['fail'])): ?&gt;,0
9669,it is because you are accessing the $_post array without checking that the key exists.,0
9670,you must check that the key exists before accessing it:,0
9671,"if you do not check if it is set then you will get errors, if the form is not submitted:",0
9673,"* it does not matter how that traffic is generated, it counts either way.",0
9674,"think of it as bits traveling through the network cable, that's what counts.",0
9676,"if $_request['file'] points to another server, so your server has to download the file first, it will also add upload traffic.",0
9677,"on the 3rd line, you are searching for the string ""1"".",0
9678,"since your first call replaced ""7"" with ""1mbps..."", the 3rd line will replace the ""1"" in that sentence as well.",0
9679,"i would recommend iterating over the array, or use some regex.",0
9680,you can use implode and explode function to do this,0
9681,"there is no setting, neither in php, pdo or mysql, that will tell mysql to return all dates as timestamps.",0
9682,just select your data in the format you need.,0
9684,do not solve problems that don't exist.,0
9688,-- is a comment and is used to make sure nothing that would normally come after the injected string is processed.,0
9689,"however (again), it is my understanding that mysql by default automatically closes the db connection at the end of a single statement's execution.",0
9690,"so even if i did get so far as to try and drop a table, mysql would cause that second statement to fail.",0
9691,"depending on what happens to the data once it goes to the database, i may not want to inject any sql at all.",0
9693,which is also something to be aware of.,0
9696,"use mysqli with prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements .",0
9697,sidenote: it appears as if you have spaces before your opening &lt;?php tag in your form; you may be outputting before header .,0
9698,"using error_reporting(e_all ^ e_deprecated); isn't enough, you need to display them.",0
9699,"you can use array_walk_recursive function, to go throw all leaves of the array, and escape values:",0
9700,"also, it is good to follow data consistency rules, and do not use !is_array() , but is_string() , because mysql_real_escape_string takes string params, not !string .",0
9703,"i don't want to copy answer, you can find it here",0
9707,you need to declare your array in php before you try and append a value to it:,0
9708,"if you do this, the error will disappear and the output will no longer be invalid json.",0
9710,"you also set the request content type to application/json , but the actual type of the data you passed is application/x-www-form-urlencoded .",0
9711,php will not decode the data you sent and $_post will not be populated.,0
9712,"yes of course you can, all you need to do is create another pdo connection to the other database.",0
9714,"this will verify (using ternary expressions) if the get variable is set, if it is, then it will apply the value to the textbox.",0
9716,"also, you shouldn't check if the submit button is set using post... it shouldn't work.",0
9717,"so what's going on with the yahoo login form is that, when the user click on the next button, the page does not do a full form post to the ""consultation page"" (page does not reload).",0
9718,"what it does is that the page itself is using javascript, and made an xmlhttprequest to the ""consultation page"", with the details provided, and gets only the result from the ""consultation page"".",0
9719,"this technique is called "" ajax "", and it's around for more than 2 decades.",0
9720,take a look here for the very simple tutorial provided by w3school: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ .,0
9721,xmlhttprequest may be too simple for the real world usage.,0
9722,so plenty javascript frameworks out there have provided wrappers for developers to use this technique without the hassles of browser compatibilities.,0
9723,"such wrappers are like the famous jquery.ajax , can do a lot of cool things that you can leverage with.",0
9724,"for your problem, you will need to do something like this:",0
9725,"when user click on a button to submit a form, instead of submitting the form, you call an javascript function to post to your second ""page"" the page that's responsible to it should receive all the parameters you have submitted in the call as per normal.",0
9727,"the page then is responsible in checking the data, do the task, and send a response back to the callee.",0
9728,"the original page that does the post, will receive the response, and you can act accordingly, such as show an alert, or do whatever related actions on the page itself.",0
9729,"pls consult documentation, what does mysql_query() return when there is an error?",0
9730,you will probably find it useful to run mysql_error() for more detail.,0
9733,"like your current code, it assumes your various $_get parameters are set - it won't match the -1 you're using if the parameter isn't set.",0
9735,it is only pseudocode because your button is not part of form and there is no $_post in your code and there is no info (in your code) what to add in query after and (column_name = value),0
9737,"according to the php docs , lastinsertid is a method of the pdo object, not the stmt object (which you are referencing via $this->_query).",0
9738,"@collind was almost correct, you do need to use an ""arrow operator"", but you should do that on the 0th element of the array.",0
9739,"what this means is that your $page is actually an array of size one, and the 0th element is the object of stdclass , and it is that class that has two fields.",0
9741,in order to access access_token you would write:,0
9742,php has a global variable that may help you with this.,0
9743,i think that what you want is http_referer .,0
9744,the best thing to do would be to print_r the php $_server variable at the top of the page http://mysite.net/aname/bname/cname/ename and then use the variable that contains the url that you want.,0
9745,so at the top of the page paste this code:,0
9746,come to think of it request_uri might be what you want.,0
9748,"this has been reported as a bug a long time ago and it is not a bug, it is expected behavior, as stated by johannes in the comment.",0
9749,"so, i guess, you have to use mysqli_ping after all.",0
9750,"two corrections before going on: 1) in your script $mysqli = new mysqli(... implies that if valid, $mysqli is an object, not a resource.",0
9751,"that's also true if it is created via $mysqli = mysqli_connect(... , though it might also be null to indicate an error.",0
9752,"use $mysqli instanceof mysqli to check that, not is_resource() .",0
9755,"a) use $mysqli instanceof mysqli to check whether the script got an instance of a mysqli connection, regardless of whether the connection is still usable or not.",0
9756,"if $mysqli is not an instance of mysqli, the script can't use the mysqli_* functions or mysqli::* methods, including mysqli_ping.",0
9757,when using $mysqli=mysqli_connect() instead of $mysqli = new mysqli(...) $mysqli might be null.,0
9758,"instanceof will ""return"" false in that case.",0
9759,same if $mysqli for some reason is false or a string or a number or ....something else other than an instance of mysqli.,0
9760,"b) if you have an instance of mysqli, you can use mysqli_ping($mysqli) or $mysqli-&gt;ping() to check whether the connection can still be used or needs to be re-established.",0
9761,"there are operations on the mysqli instance that do work without a valid connection, though those are probably not of interest to you.",0
9762,you have a number of major problems in your code.,0
9764,1) the php mysql_ functions have been deprecated.,0
9765,that means the functions will be removed in future versions of php.,0
9767,"regarding your question, i think you are asking how to change the metadata (such as a firstname) without unsetting the photo url.",0
9768,you could also use this conditional for a post request,0
9769,and check the input with a var_dump($_post); to see if the value exists in the array.,0
9770,this is only if you're expecting one form.,0
9771,if you want multiple forms on the page you could make use of naming your submit button in the html code,0
9772,you could also use this if you set an name on the submit button,0
9773,"as far i understood from your description is you have want to add marks details in table mark_list which has the following columns with i uses bootstrap,php ,mysqli.",0
9775,it looks like to previous server was set with register global on,0
9776,note: this feature has been deprecated as of php 5.3.0 and removed as of php 5.4.0.,0
9777,"it once defaulted to on , but was changed to off in php 4.2. you could still enable it in php.ini.",0
9778,"it's been deprecated as of php5.3, and removed in php 5.4.",0
9780,you could assign the array directly to the session using zend_session_namespace:,0
9781,you can use the array any way you choose.,0
9782,you can pass it to the view... $this-&gt;view-&gt;checkboxvalues = $session-&gt;checkbox_values;,0
9783,"or you can pass it to your favorite model, what ever you need to do you can do.",0
9784,the session will remain until you unset it or overwrite it.,0
9786,there are a few workarounds you can follow.,0
9788,pdo is a database abstraction layer that works with many underlying database systems.,0
9789,sqlite_num_rows only works with handles from the native sqlite extension in php.,0
9790,so you can't use sqlite_num_rows here.,0
9792,assuming you have a row in the users table that has the value jeff in the name column.,0
9793,"so you would still have 1 row, but the value of the mycount column in the result set would tell you if a match was found or not.",0
9794,"so even if you could use sqlite_num_rows here, it wouldn't help you because it would always return 1 .",0
9795,"what you really want to do is check the value of mycount in the result set, and if it is 1 then there was a match, and if it is a 0 there was not a match.",0
9796,keep in mind that if there were multiple rows in your users table that had the same name and password then count(*) would return something the number of rows where that match occurred.,0
9797,the following code should get you what you are looking for:,0
9800,"you are using hashing, but that is not needed here.",0
9801,"you're better off not building a string, but building an array.",0
9802,"the way you build the string you have a dangling comma, which you do not want.",0
9804,&amp;amp; is a predefined entity in xml and &amp;#39; is a character reference which is always allowed.,0
9805,"htmlspecialchars() should produce xml-compatible output, unlike the usually-a-mistake htmlentities() .",0
9806,what is the error you are seeing?,0
9807,"if you have to allow users to input arbitrary html, it's going to need some processing.",0
9808,"unless you really trust those users, you'll need a purifier (to stop them using dangerous scripting elements and xss-ing each other), and a tidier (to remove malformed markup either due to crap rich-text-editor output or deliberate sabotage).",0
9809,if you intend to put the content directly into xml you will also need it to convert to xhtml output and replace html entity references.,0
9810,"a simple way to do this in php would be domdocument-&gt;loadhtml followed by a walk of the dom tree removing all but known-good elements/attributes/url-schemes, followed by domdocument-&gt;savexml .",0
9811,there is no reason for something called db_connect to ever extend something called model .,0
9812,not to mention there is no reason to call something model which doesn't tell anybody anything and as such is a pretty crappy name for anything.,0
9813,secondly as far as i can see there is no reason for you to wrap mysqli to begin with.,0
9814,what do you gain by wrapping an object like that.,0
9816,finally when you get rid of that odd inheritance tree you have going on you should inject the database connection into the classes that need it.,0
9818,"isset is redundant to boolean checking, you don't have to use if you want shorter lines.",0
9819,"(updated to use non-depreciated functions as suggested by andufo; i chose explode , but you could use preg_split if you wanted.",0
9820,"as a side note if anyone still reads down this far, the accepted answer fails - try it with my first and last test case.)",0
9821,"it needed some adjustment (his function didn't set the right scale, and failed on regular decimals, and as pointed out it did not account for the length of decimal places in the scale)",0
9822,"a / was missing at the end of the uploads folder name, and should have read:",0
9824,"just as a little nugget, if you want to preserve &lt;br&gt; as standard carrage returns, you could do this:",0
9825,notice how you were using backticks instead of single quotes?,0
9826,also for some reason you closed your query quotes randomly in the middle of the query.,0
9828,you can also use or die(mysql_error()); to see what errors are occurring.,0
9829,"based upon your comment, you're checking for $_post['campo'] despite the fact that your &lt;form&gt; tag's method is a get request.",0
9830,you should instead check the value of $_get['campo'] (or $_request['campo'] ).,0
9832,"just change the method on your form to method=""post"" to get this working correctly, otherwise use $_get on the php side, if a get is what you're actually after.",0
9835,you either need to remove picture = :picture from the $query or add ':picture' =&gt; $_post['picture'] to $query_params,0
9836,"note: no need to check if (isset($_post['submit'])) { ... } here, because index.php send data to networkonline.php .",0
9839,"however, this would only throw a notice which was why your script continued to execute.",0
9840,this is because your query is not getting prepared because of wrong syntax and invalid use of placeholder.,0
9841,this function will get the integer value out of the string.,0
9842,(use the equivalent functions such as floatval() if they are not integers),0
9844,"(technically, those if's aren't necessary, but they're nice if you want a default ""not set"" value in the variables)",0
9845,"i'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but the first php part of your question can be greatly simplified:",0
9847,"i don't see where you create $to or $body , though, so that's a problem.",0
9848,this is not possible because the underlying mysql driver won't allow it:,0
9849,since every user has a role or type it means that the ability of viewing or editing content in your application is solidly connected to this factor.,0
9851,these pieces of information can be passed to $_session['user'] for example as a small array where your array key can be the userid and the usertype the value.,0
9852,once a user login your initial values are stored to session .,0
9854,but to achieve what you want you basically need to re-fetch the piece of information in the beginning of every view/page of your application.,0
9855,if new usertype has been assigned to usera simply show a message that he/she will log out automatically in 15 seconds (give time to read the message itself) in order for the changes to take effect.,0
9856,"while your user sees this message you take the current session data he/she may have and save it in database, since some session variables might be (or not) available in a upgrade or downgrade of usertype .",0
9857,by placing the comparison of the usertype in the beginning of each view/page of your application you save yourself of the headache that a user can loose data.,0
9858,"when your form is submitted, the &lt;select&gt; names are getting evaluated like &lt;select name=""raj""&gt;, &lt;select name=""kiran""&gt;, ..........&lt;select name=""sameer""&gt; etc depending on the values of $name=$row1['name']; from your query on 'student' table.",0
9859,"also you should pay consideration to the fact that your query $query2=""select * from student where ssap='$ssap'""; might return more than one rows, it seems you are assuming only one row will be returned.",0
9860,so you can not use a variable as the key in your super global $post like this $_post[$name]; when $name is undefined on your action script.,0
9862,do a var_dump($_post) on your action script.,0
9863,that may reveal most of the stuffs for you.,0
9864,i think you would need to use an extension like runkit if you wanted to redefine a class.,0
9865,"but, you could also just give the new class some form of serial name like myclassversion56.",0
9866,"use a factory to instantitate the class, and the factory knows the name of the most recent class because you set a variable somewhere.",0
9867,you could even str_replace the source code to make the serial naming automatic.,0
9868,"there's ways to define program behavior dynamically, but at some point you start to recreate a programming language, when you're already using a dynamic one like php.",0
9871,here's a quick tutorial i found to get you started if you don't know about sessions.,0

9877,upload_err_no_file value: 4; no file was uploaded.,0
9879,variable $_files['file']['tmp_name'] will hold the info about where it is stored.,0
9880,the move_uploaded_file function needs to be used to store the uploaded file to the correct location,0
9881,"ok...you also need to set up the ""selected"" attribute base on $_post['select_city'] on the option tag and remove the value=""&lt;?php if(isset($_post['city_name'])) echo $_post['city_name']; ?&gt;"" on the select tag....and like @dan revah suggested, use mysqli instead since mysql is deprecated as of php 5.5.0",0
9882,and then treat the data like any other form post to php (i.e.,0

9895,"if you want to stay away from regular expressions, you could use phpquery to handle the value, and then use jquery-style selectors and methods to get your value:",0
9896,i first set up an associative array for the default values.,0
9898,"since i mention $_get as the second parameter, it will override the values if they exist.",0
9899,"that way, you get an associative array of parameters.",0
9900,"if you want to use them as local variables, you can use extract .",0
9901,you could always just do $_server['request_uri'].,0
9903,the above includes everything before the file name.,0
9905,"you can use this service, array visualizer , this will help you target and extract only what you need.",0
9907,you're trying to do everything in on big statement.,0
9908,why not build your imploded array-strings before you include them in the sql?,0
9909,you need to make use of the isset construct first.,0
9910,"obiously the if(isset($_post[""json""])) statement is not invoked, so neither of both echos is executed.the fact that the function specified in .ajax success is invoked, only tells you that the http connection to the url was successful, it does not indicate successful processing of the data.",0
9914,when the user logs in you can set (for example):,0
9915,"sessions aren't complicated at all, but its worth looking into them.",0
9916,"this is a very basic way of using sessions, but it isn't very secure at all.",0

9919,"the single quotes are delimiters for the sql statement, and have nothing to do with php.",0
9920,"they tell mysql where the value for the field starts, and where it stops.",0
9922,which is valid sql and will select all users in your table (because the input from $_post['username'] has made the rest of the query commented out.,0
9923,"however, if you properly escape values, you end up with:",0
9924,you're reading the result set twice.,0
9926,"if you need to read the results twice, use this:",0
9928,you are sending the data via post and checking the $_get php variable which is empty because you are not sending via get .,0
9929,one possibility is to use a filter function to access the get parameter.,0
9930,"with this approach, $page will always be set, so you won't need to worry about undefined index warnings.",0
9931,"(if 'page' is not a key in $_get , filter_input will return null .)",0
9932,"then, when you need to use $page later, checking it is simpler:",0
9934,"you can use an if statement, or shorten it with a ternary.",0
9935,do not use the @ error suppression operator.,0
9936,"it is a bad practice to get into, 99.99% of the time you want to see all errors in all situations.",0
9937,"the ""best way"" in coding is a combination of opinion, established code style, and industry best practices.",0
9938,"generally speaking, one should use the right functions for the job (in this case, array_key_exists or filter_input as indicated in another answer), not use error handling, suppression, or exceptions for normal code flow, and be explicit/verbose rather than trying for the shortest code.",0
9939,"you might be able to condense something into 1 line rather than 3, but to what end?",0
9940,"all it does is increase the specific complexity of any given part of your code, making it harder for others (and yourself!)",0
9941,to understand and maintain in the future.,0
9943,then you will have to use the standard method to do it : &lt;?php echo $search; ?&gt; rather than short one : &lt;?= $search ?&gt;,0
9946,i am doing the same thing as the op and ran into the same issue.,0
9947,some of these answers don't understand how eventsource should work.,0
9948,my code is identical to yours and uses a session variable to know what view the user is on which drives what data to return in the event of a server trigger.,0
9949,it's part of a realtime collaboration app.,0
9951,"not really a fix, but it keeps the log from filling up.",0
9952,"alternatively, not sure how well it would work for your application, but you could use ajax to write the session variable you are monitoring to the database, then your eventsource script can monitor for a change in the db instead of having to start sessions.",0

9965,"during the script, any changes to the cookies are invisible.",0

9984,that isn't built into the url specification.,0
9985,"for example, example.com/test could be a file or it could be a directory (and then it automatically goes to example.com/test/index.html).",0

9998,check that your script file name ends with .php and check php is working on your system.,0
9999,you need to specify your method type so in your php code you can get it using that method.,0

10033,this can be a manually written array inside this php file or an array the values of which have been gathered from a database.,0
10034,you can also use the if/else consitions or a switch condition but that will make your code longer.,0

10068,"assuming you have control over how $xxx is used, you may want to consider using it to hold the key in the array, instead of a reference to the element at the key.",0
10069,that way you wouldn't need to search the array when you wanted to unset the element.,0
10070,but you would have to replace all sites that use $xxx with an array dereference:,0
10072,this does not mean that variable content will be destroyed.,0
10073,"however, the format that you have breaks when you have ""at"" in the string, and that's why we use str_replace to get rid of it.",0
10074,"this is a minor gotcha, if 'jpg' happens to occur at the start of the string being searched.",0

10082,"you probably mean, if you submit the form but an error is on the inputs you want to keep the selected option.",0
10083,in the event that you are trying to remove an array element based on the key and not the value you don't need to make a loop if statement.,0
10086,"without the array shift, it was putting the photograph object in an array, therefore resulting in that ""fatal error: call to a member function comments() on a non-object"" error.",0
10087,"once i added the array shift, it seemed to fix everything!",0

10093,the fix is easy: don't ^_^.,0
10094,"no, sql injections are widely misunderstood, mainly because they actually have nothing to do with sql as they are just string manipulation.",0
10096,"the data, once stored, should be in its original state.",0
10100,"so, in order to pass the value after the submission, the html code like below:",0

10109,"on top of that, if the submission includes a file upload, you'll be slurping that entire file into memory, which could very well exceed your script's memory_limit and kill things right there.",0

10113,leave a placeholder in the query where you want to substitute the dynamic value.,0
10114,you can use either positional parameters with the ?,0
10115,"symbol, or named parameters with the colon-prefix syntax.",0

10117,"in the case of named parameters, it's an associative array.",0
10118,"in the case of positional parameters, use a simple ordinal array.",0

10122,"but i did this only to match your code; ordinarily i would just reference these fields as $row[""title""] and so on.",0
10123,you need to use data option in your ajax request to send your id first:,0

10162,since you are sending the data with content-type: application/json you would need to read the raw input as php does not know how to read json into their globals like _get and _post unless you have some php extension that does it.,0
10166,"as a result, php will return the character at the position specified between the square brackets, as this is also a string, it tries to cast it as integer, resulting in 0 (so it's basically returning the character at position 0 in $check_box_values which is c ).",0
10167,"also, you don't need to loop to build the string of values, you can use implode() :",0
10169,"if , is the delimiter that you want to split the string then try with explode in php",0
10170,notes: * maybe a join query instead of nested queries would be a good idea.,0
10171,"* the data/parameters for a delete operation should not be transfered via get, but rather via post .",0
10172,"first, you can reduce the array that comes from the database to a single value like this:",0
10174,"it looks like this could be avoided if you changed the query that produces this array to only get the selected value from the database, but i am just working with what you have here.",0
10175,"if you need to handle multiple selections, you can just skip the array_filter and use in_array to check your selections like this:",0
10176,"a third party could link (or submit a hidden form with js (since you are using $_post they would have to use this approach)) to your site sending whatever data they liked (including ""&gt;&lt;script... ) as the user who visited their attack site.",0
10177,"if the user enters a "" in their data (either because it is a typo or because their data really does include a "" character), it will break when you display it back to them.",0
10178,"so on your advanced search page, you are looking at doing the following:",0
10179,the echo is actually a ternary.,0
10180,i believe isset() is probably the equivalent you are looking for.,0
10181,"basically, it checks if $_post['searchtext'] is set, and either echoes the contents of that, or nothing at all.",0
10183,"however, for your own arrays, you need to check with array_key_exists('key', $array) before checking with isset($array['key']) .",0
10184,"if it's on the same domain you can add it to a cookie, like so",0
10187,like when you do the redirect to the new page you just add the username,0
10189,one of the few places to do this in wordpress is in the functions.php file; e.g.,0
10190,"mysql_real_escape_string() is a quick and easy way to achieve this (or, if the id is always numeric, you could just use intval() ).",0
10192,"if you're not sure which request method was used, use the $_request superglobal, which contains both get and post variables (example: $_request['id'] ).",0
10193,"i normally don't use $_request , since i like to be clear about where my data comes from, but this would be a perfect situation to use it.",0
10195,"* — the ordering is configurable via the variables_order configuration directive, as stewart mentioned in the comments.",0
10196,"you don't assign the path parameter of the cookie, so it gets the path of the page it's assigning it and results to be /login or something similar and it won't be sent to other parts of your page like /home , or simply the root.",0
10198,this way you can set your data type in your string template.,0
10199,"attributes are accessed using the syntax $element['attribute_name'] , so in your case, you need $row['name'] .",0
10200,"as such, the print_r output will not give you a ""real"" view of the object, so should be used with care.",0
10201,there are a couple of alternative debug functions i've written here which give a more accurate idea of how the object will behave.,0
10203,here you can read about mysqli prepared statements and parameter binding http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php,0
10204,your cookie will only be accessible when you refresh the page or navigate to a new one.,0
10205,"when your script loads, the html header fields for that page have already been set.",0
10206,the page will need to be rendered again (another http transaction) before your cookie is available for use.,0
10207,the variable $_cookie[] representates the state at the start of the script.,0
10208,that means that you have to wait on the next page request to see the variable.,0
10209,you could also add your variable manually to the global cookie variable $_cookie['user] = 'alex porter'; but the problem is that you are not sure that the browser really accepted the cookie.,0
10210,as alternative to michael post you can use sscanf method instead of list and explode,0
10211,"in your case, that could e.g.",0
10212,"looking at your page source code, it looks like you are echoing style sheets outside of the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags, and before the &lt;!doctype ...&gt; tag - index page source code -",0
10213,it does not look like your language sessions are setting correctly.,0
10214,why also have 3 $_session variables?,0
10215,you could do it with 1 - $_session['lang'] and simplify your code -,0
10216,"as you said, assigning the function like window.onload = displaygallery; works.",0
10217,"when assigning it like window.onload = displaygallery('red'); , what is happening is that the function is not being attached to window.onload , but what it returns is.",0
10218,"and the function returns nothing, so window.onload = undefined; .",0
10220,in my experience a lot of the problems boil down to the locale settings on the server.,0
10221,this is just a quick hack to see if it's the case.,0
10222,"if not, then i'd recommend at the very least putting in var_dumps along the way to check that the date is properly formatted along the way.",0
10223,the problem is that print_r doesn't do well at displaying the output of simplexml parsing.,0
10226,see examples from the php manual for more ways to retrieve the content.,0
10227,"it is because your field name is favsport[] and it give you array in php $_post[""favsport""] you are doing echo $sportstr variable it will give you notice: array to string conversion thats why you have to use print_r() function to print array.",0
10228,use below code it might be your solution.,0
10229,to fix the problem in the comment below swap the fwrite peramaters around,0
10230,you are not creating the $hits variable that is used later in your display the first time a visit is made to a site.,0
10231,"yes, you should be using the php function htmlspecialchars http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php",0
10234,you know the names and you know the values because you created them.,0
10235,go to your page where you process the form submission and tell all the names to your code.,0
10237,but for not checked ones you will have to run a loop to match from database if its checked or not.,0
10238,"$products is an object you first need to fetch the cart value in a variable and pass that to unserialize method, assuming you are using mysqli you can try like this",0
10240,i dont see the point of using unserialize since in the code you posted you haven't use serialize .,0
10241,means that you should have used serialize before using unserialize to convert it back in a php value.,0
10242,simply change the name of your multiple select list from train_name to train_name[] as follows:,0
10243,by using print_r($user); you should see to what public-profile-url and others are mapped to.,0
10244,"your example code is a little confusing, as you are simply overwriting $query and only running a single query.",0
10246,there is not a single problem with having multiple queries prepared.,0
10248,"in order to be able to execute another query, you have to call store_result()/get_result() right after execute.",0
10250,"there is absolutely no point in making three queries, you have to make just one.",0
10251,"if you have a trouble making one, ask another question marking it with mysql tag and bringing your 3 queries along.",0
10252,even for multiple queries it's just wrong idea to do multiple fetches in a single loop.,0
10255,you need to re-read your tutorial and practice on a single query first.,0
10256,i know it's complicated but should do the job you want.,0
10258,here's an example using explode() and list() :,0
10259,"the problem is apparently that with ajax you are not going to be sent to another php page, so i couldn't see the echo $_post['work_id']; .",0
10260,"but now it works, it was the data problem…",0
10261,since you're expecting multiple rows you need to loop them using while:,0
10262,its simple to use mysqli just try the following once,0
10263,the answer is that you can't.,0
10266,what this does is silently redirect requests for,0
10267,"from php, you can consult the $_server['request_uri""] value, and apply some text transformation (substrings, regexp) if needed, but in your case using the value directly should work.",0
10268,"if this is a mysqli api, then you'll need multiple invocations of fetch_assoc() in order to get those multiple rows.",0
10269,you have only invoked -&gt;fetch_assoc() once:,0
10271,"ok, try to do it has to do with the top that says if (isset($_post['submit'])) try and give it a default value if it isn't set.",0
10272,(isset($_post['submit']))) i'm referrin to the $customoptions variable $primarycolor and $adminbg,0
10273,you can check this code i used it yesterday.,0
10274,you just have to change the name of sql part according to your goal,0
10275,also what i give you is jquery ui you have to add,0
10276,$_post[68] and $_post[28] will return the values you need.,0
10277,you should use alpha keys (country_code) instead.,0
10279,html also requires you to use unique element ids for a document to be valid.,0
10282,"your function will always return true, since every array has a first element in it, so the array is unchanged.",0
10285,"therefore, if the file was created on windows and you run your code on linux, it could try to find linux's end-of-line and fail to explode the file correctly and vice-versa.",0
10286,the index is_ajax does not exist in the array $_request .,0
10287,"your logic is wrong, you are setting a variable and getting a warning and after that you are using isset to check if the variable you just set, is set.",0
10288,check the size to see if there is actually a file:,0
10289,if you do a var_dump($_files); you will get a better understanding of the data you're receiving.,0
10291,the reason i've come to that conclusion is that i uploaded your code to my own website.,0
10293,try removing the setcookie to spare some processing.,0
10296,"as for your solution to storing database information into a user's session, you can use a couple of functions that i wrote up for just that very reason.",0
10297,"note : these use the unsupported mysql_* functions, and should not be copy/pasted without updating to a supported alternative like mysqli_*.",0
10299,"on a side note, in fact the general rules of thumb is that, you shouldn't alter user input at all.",0
10300,"you should store whatever user input as it is, into your database, so that you can retain user input as original as possible, and only escape it when you need to display or use it.",0
10302,what if my title contains a string like this &lt;my 21st birthday party!&gt; and you stripped it away?,0
10303,"try using prepared statements instead so you can insert any data into your database, without the worries of injection.",0
10304,"and only when you need the data to be displayed on a html page or console, you escape them accordingly such as htmlentities .",0
10307,you should learn either one that suits.,0
10308,with your existing setup of mysql extension the best approach to follow is at least passing the strings through mysql_real_escape_string .,0
10309,if you can move to mysqli or pdo based setup that would be ideal.,0
10310,"the reason your script is dying is because you have a large number of variables, and each of them likely have many child objects (possibly even recursively).",0
10314,your select could be returning 0 rows.,0
10315,you are using $username twice in your code.,0
10316,try this in a .htaccess file in the root of the site,0
10317,"as a side note, the $mysqli-&gt;query code you posted is vulnerable to sql injection because it doesn't call addslashes or mysql_real_escape_string on $_get['id'] .",0
10319,"first of all, $_get does not include the values of posted form parameters.",0
10323,"also, the column names have to match the rest of your code if you use the mysql_assoc option:",0
10326,you may be using your html form and php/sql inside the same file too which will cause empty values to be inserted in your database as soon as the page is loaded.,0
10328,"from then on, your attempted solution seems to rely in converting that array into a query string you will pass with a get request to another page.",0
10329,"for that matter, you can implode the array using &amp; as the glue.",0
10330,however you also said that you need to convert array items into variables.,0
10331,"for that purpose, you can create a new array in the form",0
10332,"note that i'm validating the size of the $keyvalue array, because some not every value will have the name=value pattern.",0
10334,this assumes your $user matches the user_id you need to set.,0
10335,"otherwise, you'll have to go a bit backwards to where you give form to the $myarray variable.",0
10336,"i'm afraid you'll need to, because your example starts with zero and i bet your user_id doesn't.",0
10337,"to answer your question, you need to have slashes around your pattern",0
10338,"also, asterisk means none or more, so even if you had no text, you it would still match it.",0
10339,the same would hold true for explode (but you can see if there was an empty string in the last element and return that as false).,0
10340,i am the author of the seostats package and highly recommend to not use the reference on code.google.com.,0
10341,"as stated on the project's start page, you should use the github pages instead.",0
10343,"this is at least, what your question suggests.",0
10344,"and if that is the case, you should better start here: http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.get.php to understand the example codes of seostats.",0
10345,number array serialization is very easy.,0
10346,"use join(',', $board) to form a comma-separated id string, use explode(',', $_get[""board""]) to get the array back.",0
10348,"there are a couple potential ""gotcha""s in the solution for your case.",0
10349,"since your two arrays might not have equal size, you will have to use array_search() inside a loop.",0
10350,"also, though it seems unlikely for your case, i would like to mention that if $dictionary has the keys: ""0"" or 0 then array_search() 's return value must be strictly checked for false .",0
10351,here is the method that i recommend:,0
10352,"as far as i know, mysql server does not have any charset command either.",0
10353,"you specify the charset with set names , which is a short-cut to set several related variables (all of which can be set with the set command anyway).",0
10355,"since you are using php, not the command-line client, it doesn't exist.",0
10356,"of course, the mysqli way to set the encoding is mysqli::set_charset() .",0
10357,"note: i use stdclass here, so everbody can see directly what it will become in json (an object too) and should not used with index keys.",0
10358,"print_r(json_encode([1,'foo'=&gt;'sadsd'])); will become {""0"":1,""foo"":""sadsd""} , what isnt that nice.",0
10359,you need to learn how to read php and mysqli errors you need to learn how to use mysqli properly you don't heed this function at all,0
10360,how to get mysqli error in different environments?,0
10363,"firstly, $_post['image'] suggests that we are dealing with files and if so, your form requires a valid enctype, a post method, plus you would need to use $_files rather than $_post if that is the case.",0
10365,"you may be getting undefined index notices, but they're not being displayed.",0
10366,what you also need to do is to have a primary key; that usually fixes things.,0
10367,"plus, you are also using the mysql reserved word timestamp , and it should be wrapped in ticks.",0
10370,i guess you want to access mysql database installed on different computers on same network as your computer and also on some remote server.,0
10371,what you need is ip addresses of all the computers on which the mysql server is installed including the remote server.,0
10396,right now you seem to be mixing object-oriented and procedural approaches.,0
10397,"if you want to use object-orented approach, mysqli object should be instantiated as follows:",0
10398,"if you want to use procedural approach, mysqli connection resource should be created as follows:",0
10401,you can use just a link with get variables instead of a form.,0
10402,here's an example for your case:,0
10403,"as mentioned in comments (and the error message), you cannot pass the result of an expression to isset.",0
10404,"you can use multiple isset calls, or reverse the logic of your if/else block and pass multiple parameters to isset, which i think is the cleanest solution:",0
10405,"you can clean this up a little further by setting the default value first, thus avoiding the need for an else section:",0
10406,"you can iterate through the lines, and then use explode() to separate the line by a delimiter (comma, in this case), and store the values in variables.",0
10407,"once that's done, you can simply use if statements with your logic to compare them and do whatever you want with it.",0
10408,"if you want to use foreach loop, you have to use a new array to store the results.",0
10412,"another is to use your $x variable, instead of $index in bindvalue :",0
10413,you'll have to ask the developer who wrote it.,0
10415,you use it like any other php array and it will be stored for following page loads.,0
10417,"yes, you can mix as you wish.",0
10418,"""arrays"" in php are actually hash maps, and each element may be any other php datastructure (including other arrays/hashmaps).",0
10419,"so it's not really a multidimensional array, it's a hashmap storing other hashmaps.",0
10420,"well let's say you have a bunch of possible messages, not just alogin error.",0
10421,then you would want an array of messages to iteratethrough.,0
10424,"i don'tknow of any pre-defined variables, although i don't see why you'dreally need them.",0
10425,can you clarify this question a little more?,0
10426,"$_session is a dictionary, not an array.",0
10427,"while the syntax may look similar, you can insert as many things you want in a dictionary without having to redeclare it.",0
10428,"$_session has a another dictionary variable stored in its 'msg' slot, so when you access $_session['msg'] it returns another dictionary, which you can then add a 'login-err' slot in which points to implode('&lt;br /&gt;',$err); .",0
10429,i guess whoever wrote the code wanted to organize all the messages together as one slot in the $_session dictionary.,0
10431,try using $getitem-&gt;closecursor() before each recursive call to pullitem or else you will have a multitude of unfetched rows from the prepared results.,0
10432,"if you still need to fetch items from $getitem , you should instead populate them into an array using fetchall rather than burdening pdo with a multitude of unfetched results.",0
10433,"you should be aware of memory limits at that point, however.",0
10436,"i'm not sure how you manage your app, but a success should go to a success page, unless you explicitly set a forward url.",0
10438,this means you can iterate it directly:,0
10439,"i think the $subject of your str_replace should be $time, otherwise you're doing a search and replace on the string 'august'",0
10440,"however, you probably want to use empty() instead of isset() .",0
10443,try moving all echo lines somewhere below the setcookie call.,0
10445,setting all the parameters in the setcookie function fixed it.,0
10446,add extra fields for the text and fileupload use php pick up all the submitted data use sql statements to insert the data,0
10456,that is not a difficult change.,0
10457,"to handle the text fields, there are a few ways.",0
10459,"then, looping to go through the files, you can obtain the corresponding text field with $_post['text'.$i] ( $i being the loop counter).",0
10460,"alternatively, you could build up an array of text values first, then process text values and file uploads together.",0
10461,"however, mysql maintains the state of the database connection, which won't survive the process.",0
10462,"each new page requires a new connection to be built, so you can't store a mysql connection in $_session .",0
10463,your solution is to store the database connection parameters and recreate the connection at the top of every page.,0
10464,"you shouldn't use $model-&gt;attributes=$_post['users'] after a manual attribution, your field might be re-attributed if they are in the model rules.",0
10465,note that you can use $model-&gt;save(false) to override the model validation.,0
10466,i think that your check if there is a _post value is wrong.,0
10467,"you need to give the submit button a name, if that's what you're using to check if the form is submitted...",0
10468,"or if you dont want to change the submit button, you can check isset on the category input instead",0
10469,"the problem is that php does not automatically know that you want to compare to strtolower(substr($file, -3)) in each ""or"" section.",0
10470,you need to explicitly state this:,0
10471,"the way you tried it does not work because the comparison operator == is a binary operator and expects two operands, i.e.",0
10472,"the same applies to the logical or operator that is also a binary operator, i.e.",0
10473,that means you would need to write something like this:,0
10474,"here $ext is just used to avoid repeated call of strtolower(substr($file, -3)) .",0
10475,in this case each binary operator has two operands:,0
10478,"if you want to compare using || , here's the syntax:",0
10480,"one last thing, if you have simple strings like those, ones who you don't want php to expand variables and stuff inside, use single qutations instead of doubles , that is a good practice and saves some execution time (of course barely noticed with a string or two, but it's a good practice on the long range).",0
10481,one solution would be to explode those strings by comma and verify if the resulted arrays intersection count is the same as your search:,0
10482,"also, we increment $cntneeded variable if value if found.",0
10483,at the end of foreach loop compare value of $cntneeded &amp; $arrneeded are same then all values are found into $mainstring else not.,0
10484,i think you just need to loop in your exploded array and then replace - with :,0
10485,"yes, you do have to worry about sql injection attacks.",0
10491,"instead of using preg_split, i needed to use explode and convert the comma delimited string to an array of id's that could be passed to the where in clause.",0
10493,it looks like the content of file is not placed in a database field.,0
10494,"check lenght of this field, the content can be very long (mediumtext or longtext).also you need to check the type of uploading file, you can do it by function ""mime_content_type"".",0
10495,and if user will upload gif.,0
10496,"or .png file header(""content-type: image/jpeg"") would set wrong information, you can use more versatile header header(""content-type: image/*"").and use for the live sites pdo or other orm, because your method have many vulnerabilities.",0
10498,all theses tests seem to work as expected.,0
10499,"if you see any mistakes, let me know, please.",0
10500,the condition you are testing for to see if the form has been submitted is no longer true.,0
10501,"additionally, your button has no value attribute, you'll need to add one (since otherwise $_post['submit'] still isn't true)",0
10502,you should also add some content to the button so that people know what it does.,0
10504,"then if you want your form be single page, change the form file extension to php and include your form process code in it.",0
10505,"you shouldn't use anything to load non-lowercase urls because of the duplicate content, and that's a good thing you're doing.",0
10506,the wrong urls should fail automatically in such cases.,0
10507,"however, since you didn't show how are you making those calls, then only thing i can suggest at this point is to check if the called method exists (case-sensitive), and if not, throw/redirect to a 404 page ( header($_server[""server_protocol""].""",0
10508,"after all the chat in the comments, seems like file_exists is not case-sensitive in your case, which is really weird.",0
10509,hopefully someone will be able to figure it out so i can delete this (keeping it because of the info in the comments).,0
10510,then from there you can implode those arrays if you need them as strings.,0
10513,"to get a dump of what is posted, you can use, for instance :",0
10514,this will show you which variables you can use on the php side.,0
10517,should be (you don't need the quotes around your parameter),0
10523,this will destroy their entire session.,0
10525,ajax calls in an interval will put extra load on server.,0
10526,if you want real-time response to your actions(e.g.,0
10527,"the user will be signed out right when you ban them from your system backend), then you should look into something like server push .",0
10528,"the idea is to keep a tunnel open from server to browser whenever a user is browsing your website, so that you can communicate with them from server-side too.",0
10529,"if you want them to be banned, push a logout request and the process that in your page(i.e.",0
10531,i think problem with your code is in the line where you set data: '{....}' .,0
10532,it should be in json format in order to be passed properly (though it also could be in string format but you'll need to parse it on the server side),0

10553,as long as you do this you are not vulnerable to sql injection.,0
10554,you might be vulnerabile to html-injection (causing xss) if you are html-escaping at the database end instead of the template output end.,0
10555,because any string that hasn't gone through the database (eg.,0
10556,fetched directly from $_get ) won't have been html-escaped.,0

10561,"there are 124 visible characters in your string but var_dump reports 144. which means 20 characters of padding needs to be removed (a series of ""\0"" bytes at the end of your string).",0
10562,"probably that's 4 ""\0"" bytes at the end of a block + an empty 16-bytes block (to mark the end of the data).",0

10596,instead of the general-use text manipulating function addslashes you should use the escaping function matching your database system.,0

10600,"after having talked about the php side, a few more hints concerning mysql.",0
10601,mysql limits the length of data packets being sent to it.,0
10602,"if you use a shared hosting platform (and no dedicated server), chances are high of being limited to only 1 mb.",0
10604,this setting will limit the ability to store documents in the database.,0
10606,"you are not sending json to the server, just a normal query string (both before and after the edit), nor are you processing json on the server side; you access your variables via the super-global $_request .",0
10607,now you don't have to parse the json manually in your success handler.,0
10609,you read $_session['clientnamefour'] but never write to it... i think you're confusing $_session with $_post .,0
10610,"if you used $_post instead, $_post['clientnamefour'] would be the value of the &lt;select&gt; as the &lt;select&gt; has a name attribute of 'clientnamefour'.",0
10611,"the issue you are experiencing at work is probably caused by the persistent connect frature, which is not however specific for pdo, but available for all the drivers via mysql api.",0
10612,"its the only purpose to keep the connection opened, regardless of the lifetime of the script.",0
10613,"however, one have not to be mistaken on the nature of the feature: from the script point of view it's always brand new connection.",0
10614,in your example $p is your query.,0
10615,the query is an array of the result items.,0
10617,"but because it could be the case that there was not a single player in one team, a much cleaner solution would be to start a whole new query just for the teamname.",0
10618,furthermore it would be helpful to see the exception that came up in your example.,0
10619,so $p is your pdo statement.,0
10621,"so, just as the error message says, $currentname is not an object.",0
10622,it's the string you're looking for.,0
10624,"in your while loop each iteration overwrite $_session['session_patientid'] and $_session['session_patientname'] , only the last value will be saved.",0
10625,"pass the patientid and patientname in url , then in your second page you can use $_get to get the id and name of the patient.",0
10628,so just use urlencode($_post['itemwanted']) instead of $_post['itemwanted'] and any spaces the user entered will be converted to + for when you create $url .,0
10629,"$_post['myform'] will never be present, only $_post['id'] will be.",0
10630,"unless you defined $id that we can't see, that will be null so use $_post['id'] instead.",0
10631,probably just a typo in the question but the string with the query is not closed.,0
10632,"in the form html you use &lt;?php echo $id; ?&gt; , so again you need to verify that $id holds some data and is not null/undefined.",0
10634,"and even if you do unset it, you still have references to the values that it contained in $this-&gt;id and $this-&gt;name , so their memory won't be reclaimed.",0
10635,the only memory you'll reclaim is the tiny array object that points to them.,0
10636,php doesn't make copies when you do assignments.,0
10637,"strings and numbers are immutable, so there's no need to copy them.",0
10638,"and arrays use copy-on-write technology, so it only copies them later if the old reference still exists and you then modify the copy.",0
10639,"it looks like you should either use [$loopcounter] or [] , but not both.",0
10641,"they're unnecessary and in the case of ""$myrow[3]"" they interfere with the variable interpolation.",0
10643,these will display arrays within arrays while a simple echo will not.,0
10644,"i assume you don't want to have the $rowdata[] parts written in the query, but the actual value of that array-entry?",0
10646,"remember, you are looping every field, which means, you dont need to do any implode on the data.",0
10647,i assume that your data sets are inside the array $data and $field_names is just a list of fieldnames.,0
10648,you have to create two separated connections for that.but you can also change that class to use pdo or find another one.,0
10649,the efficient way is to program against interfaces .,0
10650,the zebra_mptt library should define an interface for the database adapter it uses so that you can replace it with one that is re-using your database connection.,0
10651,"as it currently doesn't, you would need to refactor it, encapsulate the database interaction calls into the standard database connection object for that library, then extract the interface of that connection object and then create your pdo variant and inject it instead.",0
10652,"i just took a brief look, the class is rather straight forward so this should be merely straight forward.",0
10653,all it does is firering some sql queries and in the very beginning checking if the database is online which you can easily map and defer.,0
10654,"in case you don't want to do that, you can take a pre-existing wrapper for the mysql_* interface, either replace the prefix in the existing library or just disable the mysql extension and then let it create the functions based on pdo.",0
10656,use htmlspecialchars() instead of htmlentities() if this is all you are worried about.,0
10657,"if you have encoding mismatches between the representation of your data and the encoding of your xml document, htmlentities() may serve to work around/cover them up (it will bloat your xml size in doing so).",0
10658,i believe it's better to get your encodings consistent and just use htmlspecialchars() .,0
10659,"also, be aware that if you pump the return value of htmlspecialchars() inside xml attributes delimited with single quotes, you will need to pass the ent_quotes flag as well so that any single quotes in your source string are properly encoded as well.",0
10660,"i suggest doing this anyway, as it makes your code immune to bugs resulting from someone using single quotes for xml attributes in the future.",0
10661,htmlentities() will convert a number of non-ansi characters (i assume this is what you mean by utf-8 data) to entities (which are represented with just ansi characters).,0
10662,"however, it cannot do so for any characters which do not have a corresponding entity, and so cannot guarantee that its return value consists only of ansi characters.",0
10664,"only 3 or 4 characters need to be escaped in a string of xml content: &gt; , &lt; , &amp; , and optional "" .",0
10665,"please read http://www.w3.org/tr/rec-xml/ ""2.4 character data and markup"" and ""4.6 predefined entities"".",0
10668,you will need to change your code to something like this:,0
10671,nb : you need to check if the username does not exist before inserting it.,0
10672,"they have error_reporting turned down, which is nice because it means you can do things like",0
10673,you can add the accepted tags to strip_tags as second parameter,0
10674,if you want to send email on $_post['mail'] then use following.,0
10675,"the issue wasn't with the variables themselves, as they were echoing out correctly in every loop i attempted the check with.",0
10676,the issue was actually with the strpos .,0
10679,"however unfortunately the search was not working for us, as implode() was not able to split the strings for our japanese customers.",0
10680,"as per your array, i think there is no need to use array_search() , you can also concatenate the $key with product value as:",0
10681,"as you can see, there is no id value (or any other value).",0
10683,"now, the page you're currently viewing may have that value in the url you previously requested .",0
10685,all it knows is the request that you send it.,0
10686,and that request doesn't contain that value.,0
10687,"you can, when loading the page, put that value on the request.",0
10688,in index.php read the $_get['id'] value and output it to the javascript code which is making that ajax request.,0
10689,"technically it could be something as simple as this, just to demonstrate:",0
10690,"however , be aware of the dangers of outputting raw user input to the page.",0
10691,this results in things like xss vulnerabilities .,0
10692,"be mindful of what you're outputting to the page, but ultimately you need to output that value somewhere in order for that javascript code to send it to the next (ajax) request.",0
10693,"(or, alternatively, you could store the file server-side in session state or something similar.",0
10694,thereby removing the url from the equation entirely.,0
10695,there are pros and cons either way.),0
10696,"in short, you need to include the value on the url being requested if the page at that url is going to read the value.",0
10697,the code can only read values which are there.,0
10699,these functions are marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major php release.,0
10700,"so if $_post['cbox'] is an array, you must handle it as an array.",0
10701,just have a look at the php manual for pdo or the mysqli extension.,0
10702,you stored the element of your array inside another array while looping.,0
10704,you won't be able to do unset only certain values in an array.,0
10705,"rather, just save the values of those variables, unset the entire array and then reset the values.",0
10707,i believe there is a different pdo for php 5.on my system (centos 6) i have php70u-pdo.i686 .,0
10708,i checked by using yum list installed |grep pdo .,0
10709,"i can't guide you to install on osx, i suspect you need to use brew , but check to see if you can install pdo for php7 and enable it in your php.ini file.",0
10711,"edit: by the way, you always need to prepare your data for use in a database.",0
10712,i prefer prepared statements / pdo but if you use regular mysql you need to escape your variables before you insert them using something like mysql_real_escape_string .,0
10713,always use $var = mysql_real_escape_string($_post['var'') ; always surround your $vars used for values in a query with ' single quotes.,0
10715,you will need to check all table names and field names against a list of pre-approved table and field names.,0
10716,"if you must use dynamic field and/or column names, escape them with ```; this is not for security but to prevent syntax errors in your query when using reserved words or numbers as column/table names.",0
10717,see this question for more details: how to prevent sql injection with dynamic tablenames?,0
10718,"in your loop you need to add a counter to identify whether you're currently on an 'even' or an 'odd' iteration, and then add either class 'odd' or 'even' into the as you output it.",0
10720,"for example, strlen will tell you whether a variable has length or not (to put out 'gradex'), and strpos will allow you to check if a varibale contains a string (for 'gradec').",0
10721,easiest way i have found to do this using a httpurlconnection is via putting the additional info directly onto the url.,0
10722,"once you append these arguments onto your url, you can access them via $_get['name1'] and $_get['name2'] etc.",0
10723,"then to construct your query string, you can use implode which will ""glue"" together the variables with &amp;",0
10724,"it is because you didnt unset it, but you told it to be [empty string]",0
10725,you are setting the session variable as a empty string.,0
10726,you should use unset() to unset the variable.,0
10727,you can get the last inserted id by using this: pdo::lastinsertid();,0
10728,"i think you are currently return the array from fetchall , which i don't think includes the id: http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetchall.php",0
10729,"it's not really replacing anything in the html, it's just echoing the return value of str_replace(""%body%"", ""khanqah"", ""&lt;body id='%body%'&gt;"") which happens to be the string &lt;body id=""khanqah""&gt; .",0
10730,you can only replace the html's body element with php if you are outputting the html with php (changing it before outputting it).,0
10736,for integers and floats you should use intval() and floatval() for the same reason.,0
10737,"lastly, you should also length cut a string to the text length of the string field, in php use substr() .",0
10738,this prevents an error if the string length is longer than the field allows (some older browsers don't support lengthcut).,0
10741,you just need to replace $_session['user_id'] with the user id you are storing while user gets logged in.,0
10743,you can't rely on getting substrings in fixed positions and lengths like in your code as they will change each time.,0
10744,"without using any api or ai, the best you can do is create an array with road types (and their abbreviations) and check if any of that words is in the string.",0
10745,for that you can use strpos for each word or regular expressions matching.,0
10746,"then you can remove that word from the string, and get the position of the first space using strpos again.",0
10747,then use that position to get the substring before the space (street number) and the substring after the space (street name).,0
10748,you need to use the $_session variable.,0
10749,it allows you to pass data between pages.,0
10750,then on any other page you can call it by using:,0
10752,otherwise you will cause a headers error.,0
10753,"on your login page, add this code at the top of the page :",0
10755,"for more persistant, ""long-lived"" variables use $_cookie variables or store values in db and access the variables from there.",0

10760,"2) your php file is simply echo 'ing a string, images/someimagename.jpg ; this is not what an image file is, you need to output the contents of this filename string.",0
10761,3) your current sql is prone to sql injection and is currently extremely insecure.,0
10762,your database can be easily corrupted/abused by nefarious web page visitors.,0
10763,4) your mysqli_fetch_array needs to be assigned to a variable for the values in the array to be used.,0
10764,if you do not have the php exif extension enabled there are various other (possibly more verbose) ways of ouputting the image type using fileinfo or mime_content_type .,0
10765,"yes, it seems to be correct.",0
10767,i prefer a simplistic approach described here .,0
10768,this should be considered valid for security purposes.,0
10769,"although make sure you get it from $_server['remote_addr'] , any other http header can be spoofed.",0
10770,$number is not automatically set to the value the &lt;input&gt; field has.,0
10771,(it was in early versions of php).,0
10772,you now have to use $_post['number'] and $_post['num'] for this.,0
10773,register_globals in your php.ini is probably off (and that's a good thing) and therefore you can only access those variables through $_post['num'] and $_post['number'] (you can just assign $number=$_post['number'] at the beggining of your script),0
10775,"you're wide open to sql injection, as i stated before.",0
10776,i think you want to use a comma instead of the and :,0
10778,"learn to do it right, just from the beginning.",0
10780,"here's a function that will recursively perform an ""asymmetric"" slicing of an array of n length:",0
10782,"so, for each recursion, we want to:",0
10783,slice out the element(s) that we want to $keep create a $tail - this is a subset of the array that excludes the elements that we both want to ignore and keep in the current scope ( $exclude + $include ).,0
10784,"if the $tail is not empty, create a new level of recursion.",0
10785,otherwise stop recursion and merge all current $keep elements with the result of the next level of recursion.,0
10786,"if you are using php version 5.5 or above, this is also a good use case for a generator .",0

10794,"on posting back, $_post['sub'] then will be an array (see print_r($_post['sub']) ), where the id is the key.",0
10795,"the value of the array will be ""true"" (string - not a boolean!)",0
10796,in case the checkbox has been checked.,0
10797,"i really like this answer from number 2 , and am inclined to believe it seems indeed one of the most efficient way to filter out an integer.",0
10798,your first method looks ok but i think it may fail in some odd cases.,0
10800,"you could easily slap up a couple of tests and a script with the code you you have, each method in their own function, and benchmark this by calling each function 1000 times, you will right away have an idea of the optimal solution 'perfomance-wise'.",0
10801,i can assure sure the prettiest code is not always the best!,0
10802,i have had to push out some ugly hacks for the sake of performance myself.,0
10803,"as long as your tests are rigourous, and updated as needed (very important) to reflect whatever the requirements of the code it is testing, you can use whatever implementation you like that passes the tests i keep talking about .",0
10804,"in this case the requirements are quite minimal, it is quite easy to test .",0
10805,you could also invoke array_shift() twice on the array.,0
10806,this might be more optimal since it shouldn't need to make a copy of the array.,0
10807,you have to remove the quotes around the variables.,0
10810,take a look here reload mysql data inside a div using ajax,0
10811,the problem is that many rss or atom feeds have namespaces defined which don't play nicely with simplexml.,0
10812,"in the example below, i'm using str_replace to replace xmlns= to ns= .",0
10813,i'm then using the name of the root element to determine the type of feed (whether it's rss or atom).,0
10814,the array_push call takes care of adding all of the entries to the $entries array which you can then use later.,0
10815,there is no vulnerability as long as the logfile is treated by its consumers as plain text (which it should always be).,0
10816,"if you decide to output the unprocessed contents of the logfile as part of some html, then it would be a real vulnerability (probably of not very severe practical impact, but still).",0
10817,"but the issue would be with the ""other"" code that displays text inside html without calling htmlspecialchars , not with this code here that simply writes the log.",0
10818,that would depend on what $fh is.,0
10819,"if $fh is a html file, you can be in trouble.",0
10821,one is the mysqli_connect() and the other is your basic query.,0
10823,try checking your database connection using the mysqli_error() method.,0
10824,"as you might fairly be a newcomer to php, on one hand it is great to follow tutorials,however chosing a right source might be a frequent disasterous problem.",0
10826,"if you go to official php documentation and search for mysql method, it is going to tell you about its deprecation.",0
10827,"problem here, though, is not a way you interact with database, your style of coding still works and many people still do it just like that.",0
10828,"if it is not a case and you still get a 'fail' error statement, you will need to do a very little debugging and people here will be able to help you out",0
10829,"so, you will need to use following instead of what you have now",0
10832,if you want to get the checkboxes that have been ticked then something like this would do it:-,0
10833,"put out the checkbox with a value of the price, and a hidden field containing the item_name.",0
10834,the index of these arrays should match.,0
10836,"used a sequence number to force the index of the arrays of form elements (probably should be necessary, but i prefer to force things) rather than using a field from the table.",0
10840,this helps should one of your clients request a port of your application to a different database.,0
10841,prepared statements in pdo support named placeholders in addition to the positional ( ? ),0
10842,pdo supports binding a single parameter at a time instead of all parameters at once.,0
10843,"this allows stepping through an array of arguments and binding each, instead of having to construct a type string and then use call_user_func_array() black magic.",0
10846,"this is documented , and there's a feature request to change this casting to string .)",0
10847,items 2 through 4 combine to make it much easier to express the right side of operator in in a provably injection-safe manner.,0
10848,"with pdo, you can build an associative array with sequential names (such as [':likeval0'=&gt;$val0, ':likeval1'=&gt;$val1, ':likeval2'=&gt;$val2]) and then safely build a placeholder list on the right side out of that array.",0

10878,"thus, option number one presents a cleaner interface ( input_get / $_get ) for kicking off your security duties.",0
10879,option number two requires (if you are trying to be thorough) you to filter and validate the entire string as a first step.,0
10880,the second step (generally) will be to break up and extract what you hope to gather from the larger string.,0
10881,"again, you should be filtering and validating each piece of the string.",0
10884,"but, for the most part, you can just start filtering and validating the elements you expect to receive in input_get or $_get .",0
10885,"note, however, that option one is mainly for people that truly understand how regular expressions work and how this applies to potential urls your server may receive.",0
10886,"if you need more than one rewriterule , it could be so that you can have something like this (or other reasons) come into the server.",0
10887,this makes it easier to filter and validate your inputs.,0

10930,you need to check both $mysqli and $statement .,0
10933,rather than passing $result in to mysqli_affected_rows you actually want to pass the db link (returned by mysqli_connect ) which will give you the number of rows affected by the previous query.,0
10934,the mysqli object contains the count of the affected rows not the result set.i recommend you to use mysqli with oo style or try pdo.,0
10935,you probably use somewhere in your code session_cache_limiter function.,0
10936,and in documentation there's info you need to use it before session_start and not after.,0
10938,what happens when you launch the above code?,0
10939,are there any errors or warnings?,0
10943,it's tempting to shove all that escaping stuff in its own box at the top of the script and then forget about it.,0
10944,"but text preparation really doesn't work like that , and if you pretend it does you'll find your database irreparably full of double-encoded crud, backslashes on your html page and security holes you didn't spot because you were taking data from a source other than the (encoded) parameters.",0

10993,i'm assuming here that the url in your question is an api that is guaranteed to return json strings.,0
10994,i didn't understand the purpose of the str_replace in your first code sample.,0

10996,"updating based on your output with lots of this: ,,,,,, - chances are you have blank fields in your database.",0
10997,you're still adding those to the array and they're still being comma seperated.,0

11010,maybe the code snippet below can help you.,0
11011,i use explode to get the values.,0
11013,this call will restore the $_session array to what it was after the previous request.,0
11014,"php resources are freed after the php script is executed, so it makes no sense to store them in a session.",0

11041,there's also no need to use formdata in the javascript.,0
11042,that's generally only needed if you're uploading a file.,0
11043,"for other inputs, you can use the .serialize() method:",0
11045,"a shorter way, mysql only (since it does not distinguish between keys and values) would be",0

11049,"note: calling header() shouldn't work if you have already done any output with echo , so you must have some sort of output buffering going on.",0
11050,but the point is that you don't see your echo output because of the immediate redirect.,0
11051,"you should save them in $_session , $_cookie , or a database if you need them later.",0

11056,"firstly, check whether you really have any errors in php - it's notoriously crap at telling you.",0
11057,there is an option you can set on pdo objects to throw an exception on database error - i recommend you set it.,0
11058,in that case you need to re-examine how your application uses transactions and try to see if you can get it properly consistent.,0
11059,"using transactions is nontrivial; it needs either a lot of code to get things right, or some well thought out wrapper code or something.",0

11062,you seem to be expecting $_post to contain simple objects (aka stdclass ) and it simply doesn't.,0

11064,"see this question for some ideas if you really want to translate every $_post[""data""] field into an object.",0
11065,but that would be expensive and unnecessary.,0

11082,use $_server['request_uri'] rather than $_server['php_self'] .,0
11083,wrap the code inside a function.,0

11091,"different escaping functions should be used for different situations, for example:",0
11093,"'""&gt;'; (see also http_build_query ) mysql_real_escape_string for variables going in a sql statement (though i prefer bind variable) htmlentities for strings you want to display to the user, that may possibly have html within (see also strip_tags )",0

11096,take this code http://pastebin.com/jw4zp3f5 and prove it is a vulnerable.,0
11098,but noone has proven that it really is.,0
11101,your error had to do with the spaces that existed in the string inside:,0
11102,as far as i can see $logged could be whatever and thus you get the error.,0
11104,ok. take everything out of global.php.,0
11106,then you have to move the sql query that checks the password and the username against the database to login.php instead of global.php and have it like this.,0
11107,you do not need these in login.php (replace them with the code above),0
11109,using str_replace is a little tricky.,0
11110,"trying to find and remove a removes all the ""a"" in the text even in ""animal"".",0

11114,the result will be empty since the index of this array are the words and the values the number of time the words appear in the text.,0
11115,"also with str_word_count you must be really careful, since you are reading hispanic text and text can have numbers you shoudl use this",0
11116,"you declare a variable vipemail , but you send member : email , email is not defined.",0
11117,then you look for $_post['email'] instead of $_post['member'] .,0
11118,i don't know what is exactly the problem.,0
11119,"but i think the encoding is caused by the ""htmlentities()"" function.",0
11120,"recommend using the correct api endpoint ( https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json ), using json instead of rss, and not bothering with htmlentities until you're actually showing the data.",0

11123,so apache was looking for /county/favicon.ico instead of /favicon.ico .,0

11148,this is happening because &lt;iframe is at the beginning of your $string meaning that strpos will return 0 cause the &lt;ifrma start from the position 0and because empty(0) will return true (meaning it is empty) which is not true in our cause because 0 in our case means something.,0
11149,to solve this problem just replace !empty($test) with $test &gt;= 0 something like this :,0
11151,"so, if the value is not present in the array, that's because the box wasn't checked.",0
11152,you can simplify your logic by making the values the keys in your array:,0
11153,"now, you don't have to loop over $_post['class'] .",0
11154,"instead, you can take an array of the all the keys (which you should already know):",0

11157,"be careful, as somebody can post and data they want to $_post , so it may not be only 1's and 0's.",0
11158,it looks like your query is returning false .,0
11159,i would imagine there's an error with your database connection.,0
11160,try printing your query and running it manually on your database to confirm it's running properly.,0
11161,you can also just try a simple:,0
11162,"this is likely because desc is a mysql reserved keyword , and it must be enclosed in backquotes in your query statement.",0
11163,always check mysql_error() to find the cause of a failed query.,0
11166,the order of key values in an associative array don't matter.,0
11167,therefore you don't need to array_push or array_unshift .,0

11172,"for performance reasons, you may wish to do this instead, so that the elements are not being constantly renumbered:",0

11175,"in setcookie(""abc"", ""xyz"", time()-3600) the trick is that this references the time on the server while the cookie expiration is dependent on the time of the host running the browser.",0
11176,"if there is a mismatch of time between the two hosts, it is possible that it a cookie may not expire.",0

11181,"the description of mvc, provided by sharpums, was quite dreadful.",0
11182,and the effort required to get the source of sharpums makes me think that it is not an opensource project .. oh well.,0
11183,"you should try to find out, at which point the signin() method gets terminated.",0
11184,free advice: do not use sharpums as the basis for you application or research in mvc as whole because of following reasons:,0
11187,"this can be handled in a single query, so you probably don't need to ask this question in the context of using pdo.",0
11188,"however, i'll present my answer as though it were a prepared statement.",0
11190,"you have to use mysqli here, because you used mysqli dor db connection",0
11192,you should read this: validating sanitizing and escaping user data .,0
11193,your select statement in the function soto_posts_filter_restrict_manage_posts is useless as you do not do anything with it.,0
11194,"also, your &lt;select&gt; code suggests that only one value can be used so why use distinct ?",0
11195,"also, shouldn't that statement link to the post id ?",0
11196,this is surely why you don't get the results you are expecting.,0
11197,i would suggest you add some var_dump here and there and validate each steps in your process to make sure you have the expected outcome all the way.,0
11199,"add this javascript file to the bottom of your page, just before closing &lt;/body&gt;",0
11200,see full example of accepted solution with sample code for more details here : delete mysqli record without showing the id in the url then using jquery remove that record from the page which will give more good ui experience.,0
11203,although you will need some phpdoc to make code completion work.,0
11204,"your ajax code is working fine, but your getinfo.php page has some errors.",0
11206,so you need to consider using mysqli or pdo.,0
11207,check if the query has executed properly.,0
11208,"in your html(first code), the argument that you are the passing was ""this"" but in your showinformation() you are treating it as a string.",0
11209,you can directly pass the $seatid.,0
11210,if you're trying to determine the session timezone you can use this query:,0
11211,and in php:you can either use the $_server['request_time'] variable,0
11214,"if this is on the same page, you can just omit it or use $_server['php_self'] , then catch the form submission.",0
11215,"inside that process, then invoke your custom function.",0
11216,an easy fix would be just to quote the string inside it:,0
11218,"it turned out that while trying to load a url using curl, i had to include either the http:// and/or the www.",0
11219,"without them, curl would not open the url.",0
11220,i eventually coded a script that would try the different combinations of these as not all sites responded to one particular combo.,0
11221,i see from your last comment that the url in your var_dump contains neither of these.,0
11222,if you add them then hopefully this will resolve your issue.,0
11225,"if you wanted to use it in your second class too, you could construct it in the same way or extend your first class.",0
11226,is what it have to be.,0
11227,you should create a mysqli instance somewhere outside the class and then pass it in coustructor.,0
11228,"i don't know if it's applicable to you, but a solution that i came with was put a apostrophe in front of it!",0
11229,"the excel itself omit the apostrophe and only show data as text, not as a excel timestamp.",0
11230,"in that way you can explode the data by ""/"" and put it in the way you want.",0
11231,"but, if is impossible to you put a apostrophe in front in every one of them, you can verifiy if is a number and try to convert the excel timestamp to unix timestamp , assuming you server a *nix like.",0
11232,i think you must allow access to both $_get and $_post at the same time.,0
11233,and i don't think you can just merge them together either.,0
11234,"(you can have the option to, like php and the ill concieved $_request .)",0
11235,you could get a request like:,0
11236,"note that the variable name type is used twice, but in different scopes!",0
11240,"you do not have to do this, please refer to the manual http://php.net/explode to understand.",0
11242,you should check that with a var_dump() of the $i variables and you can solve it by trimming it:,0
11244,"first of all, it's possible for two people to use your web site at exactly the same time, and their submissions would get confused.",0
11245,"second, the time could change between inserting into the application table and the clothes table (datetimes are precise to the second, and maybe the first insert was at time t.999 and the second at t+1.000; this second problem can be resolved by assigning a variable to the time at the beginning of the script, and using that in all your inserts.",0
11246,"but because of the first problem, you should still not use timestamps for this.",0
11247,"instead, you should assign a unique id to the application.",0
11248,this is easily done in mysql by having an id column with the auto-increment option.,0
11250,the function mysql_insert_id() will return the value that was assigned in the last insertion you did.,0
11251,"in the clothes table, you add an application_id column, which contains that id.",0
11253,the next thing you have to deal with is how to handle multiple clothes column in the form.,0
11254,"in each row that you added, you gave the form elements the same names as in the previous row.",0
11255,"when php is processing the form, $_post['kind'] can only get one of them.",0
11257,this tells php that it should create an array of these inputs.,0
11258,"you can then get the kind of the first row as $_get['kind'][0] , the second row is $_get['kind'][1] , and so on.",0
11259,"so when you're writing to the database, you can do:",0
11261,they have been superceded by mysqli_xxx and pdo.,0
11262,"these allow you to create ""prepared"" statements, so you don't have to substitute variables into strings as above, which potentially allows sql-injection attacks unless you're careful to sanitize your data (i didn't do so above for expediency).",0
11263,"if this solves your problem, then, as others have commented, your problem is that $data is not a string, and instead an array, or an object that got tostring ed when you print_r ed.",0
11266,"third, instead of the foreach loop to copy the parameters, use array_merge like this:",0
11267,"the resulting array will also have the numeric indexes of the matches, but you can just ignore them or filter your wanted keys with array_intersect_keys .",0
11268,"the \w+ pattern matches all ""word"" characters, you may replace it with character classes like [-a-za-z0-9_] or something similar.",0
11269,you have to echo inside if condition or you have to set variable globally,0
11271,you may need to configure php with the option: --with-mysql = path_to_mysql,0
11272,if you change the name of your inputs to something like userids[&lt;?,0
11273,"echo $userid; ?&gt;] you will get the array $_post['userids'] on the receiving page, which is useful if you want to add more inputs with additional information.",0
11274,this array can be used like above:,0
11275,you seem to have ended a php code section with ?&gt; and not started a new one with &lt;?php - although i shall assume that this is simply a copy/paste error since you are not complaining that you can see your php source code in the browser.,0
11276,"the actual problem you have here is that you are checking if $_post['submit'] is set, but it never will be because you didn't name any of your form controls submit , so none of the code in the if block will ever be executed.",0
11277,"in general, session_start() will start a session that is not yet started or give you access to an existing session.",0
11279,"the script you have creates the 'cart_x' element of the $_session array, where x is whatever is in $_get['add'] , corresponding to a product id.",0
11280,consider separating the cart from the objects contained in it as follows:,0
11283,"instead of echo $_session['cart_1'] try print_r($_session['cart']) between &lt;pre&gt; tags to see what's in the cart, and put session_start() in your index page as well if you need access to the variable there.",0
11285,something i came across with pdo and blobs is that you can use that for encrypted data in mysql.,0
11286,a good example of using blobs with encryption (so information in the database itself is encrypted) can be seen in:,0
11287,i think the article why you should be using php's pdo for database access is great.,0
11288,"it is simple, clear, and organized.",0
11289,"if this doesn't work, then $row['typeofdog'] does not equal 'labrador' .",0
11290,"in that case, try echoing $row['typeofdog'] just before the conditional so you can see what is being compared.",0
11291,"also, yes, you are at risk for sql injection.",0
11295,"secondly, the database isn't getting updated because you need to concatenate (again, don't do this, please!)",0
11296,also the syntax for mysqli_query is wrong as stated in the comments on your post.,0
11300,"to me there's no clear logic on how you want to sort the results, but in such case, if you want one to be very first, just add another column to your table, like priority and it to i.e.",0
11301,0 for all rows then set it to i.e.,0
11302,1 or higher for favorite row and then select with order by priority desc and voila.,0
11303,have you tried adding what you want after declaring $arr like follows:,0
11307,"for the sake of simplicity i accessed keys directly, but in production you should always check whether this key is present inside the array.",0
11308,"fetch_into is used for adding data into an already existing class, so in your case using fetch_class makes more sense.",0
11309,"side note: since you are already using pdo, you might as well take advantage of prepared statements .",0
11310,this provides the benefit of not having to worry about sql injections.,0
11311,the only thing in your code that would change is:,0
11312,you have got a design flaw.a query has to be triggered by a repository/entity manager or by a controller if you are on really small-size application.,0
11313,i will give you the code as it has to be if it is in the controller:,0
11314,you forgot to put session_start() at the top of the page.,0
11315,you can check if $index is too big by comparing it to the number of items in your array:,0
11316,"you need to define enctype,method type(get or post) in form and make html like this:",0
11320,unless you use $statement-&gt;store_result() you don't need to call $statement-&gt;free_result() http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.free-result.php as opposed to freeing the memory allocated by $statement-&gt;get_result http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-result.free.php,0
11322,doing this will use less resources as it only has to connect to google's servers in one step rather than sending off several requests.,0
11325,foreach creates a copy of the array.,0
11326,your $value will not be changed in the original array.,0
11329,the first approach takes more code.,0
11330,the latter is less reliable since the text could potentially contain a regular less than that is not a tag.,0
11331,"a good trade-off between reliability and amount of code would be to compare the original string against the stripped string and then only return the substring from beginning to the first different character, e.g.",0
11332,"note that none of these approaches take into account that there might be text outside tags, e.g.",0
11334,reaching the mysql database connection limit is hard in oop php because it destructs the connection object if the script is finished.,0
11335,"just to be safe, have a destruct function in your class and unset the object at the end of the script.",0
11336,if you are really worried about reaching the connection cap you can go into mysql and modify the max_connection_limit from i think 1000 to higher and increase the buffer pool.,0
11337,"additionally you might look into switching languages to like java which has a technique called ""connection pooling.""",0
11338,no this is not the same as p_connect or whatever it is in php.,0
11339,"you can use the explode() function to separate the differents value by # , then apply filter_var() to extract only numeric values.",0
11342,the fact that those elements are themselves arrays is irrelevant.,0
11343,using an anonymous function as in the previous reply gave a 30-35% improvement over passing usort () the name of a defined function.,0
11346,extracting the column without array_column () on a pre-5.5 server never quite halved the differential at best.,0
11347,"check weather your file where you are writing the code have .balde.php extension, as {{ }} is only accessed through blade engine.",0
11349,"you can fetch through database or request, for this you need to learn from database documentation or request documentation respectively.",0
11353,shifting following indexed data to previous index to decrease line counts but this will increase your programming complexity.,0
11354,those are the dangers when using input data from the user to operate with the database.,0
11355,"some input might cause the sql-syntax to break, the database will get a badly formatted statement and run onto an error (if it was unintentionally) or even execute statements it was not supposed to (sql injection).",0
11356,a possibility for unintended syntax breaking would be to ask the user for his name and he inserts something like o'connor.,0
11357,way to treat them: how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
11359,"so if you want to let your users use html for a blogpost or whatever, you can a library like this which will allow certain elements and defuse the dangerous stuff.",0
11361,"put the names of the user into the database, use the id or a hash or something you generated as the filename.",0
11362,remember : treat the data based on the context in which you are using it!,0
11363,there are different places for attacks and each one uses other weaknesses.,0
11364,so there is not the one solution to fix all the problems.,0
11367,when saving data you worry only about the charakters which might break the syntax of your sql.,0
11370,while it is not exactly required to do so but if i would submit this as an email address or phone number:,0
11371,"and you echo this out on your website and visit it, you will be redirected sending me your login cookies and now i can use that data to login as you and if by any chance you're the site admin... the type of attack is called xss.",0
11372,"and by not checking the validity of the data, there are many ways to do so but take this as an example:",0
11373,"with this code, any data saved will be valid.",0
11374,it does not say that the email address exists noor the phone number.,0
11376,"my advice, check if the data is what you expect it to be before saving it instead of storing it and fix the security issues later.",0
11377,"if you don't have php 5.3 or greater you would have to use sarfraz's (or better, delphist's) suggestion.",0
11379,this has the advantage that it is cleaner (easier to understand) and it doesn't generate warnings if the index doesn't exist in the $_get variable as i can use things like isset to check if the array index exists.,0
11381,"if you're cascading down a number of arrays, it would be faster to store the value in a temp variable:",0
11385,add the value to the array and then use array_unique() to eliminate duplicate values.,0
11387,"in your case, i don't think it is necessary to pass session variable to the object.",0
11388,"third, in speaking.php , output only string with containing the necessary name-value pairs.",0
11390,"i created a wordpress shortcode in which i was getting two things, an audio link and description for it.",0
11392,so it would be something like:,0
11393,to get multiple parameters in one variable i had to use explode() so that it could be separated.,0
11395,so the following created problems for me,0
11397,"what i did was i replaced the ',' delimiter as '*' so now my shortcode looks something like this:",0
11398,that way you have a process to filter the $_get values and make the creation of the insert easier to understand irregardless of how many values you have.,0
11399,"you're setting all your variables to the result of isset($_post['xxx']) , which is either true or false , not to the value of the input field itself.",0
11401,you're also open to an sql injection.,0
11403,"a third (or fourth, depending on how you count) is to use strpos.",0
11404,"it suppresses any and all error messages, warnings, or notifications caused by the expression you've prepended it to.",0
11405,in this case: if(@$_post['myvar']) it is probably being used because the original author did not want a notification to be emitted if $_post['myvar'] is unset.,0
11408,"you either nee to use a strict comparison === , or better yet use empty() .",0
11410,here is what i might suggest:,0
11412,"note you also need to change your code to populate $mistake , as with a returned value of 'not specified' for $phone , you would not trigger that conditional.",0
11413,bound parameters cannot be used in this way.,0
11414,"you have to input it as like :search_string in the prepared query, then add the percent signs in the bound value (i.e.",0
11416,you may want to use your user id rather than an email address though.,0
11417,the way it works is: you use these hidden input values on for your paypal button.,0
11418,when the user is transferred to paypal all of these values are sent with it.,0
11419,"one of the values you use is name=""notify_url"" when the user completes checkout paypal posts the checkout information to that url.",0
11420,in the case of php you do something like this:,0
11421,any custom information you want to have returned to you needs to go in the custom field.,0
11423,whatever value is in the custom filed will be posted back to your notify_url exactly the same way you give it to paypal.,0
11424,if you must use preg_split only then you can do:,0
11425,data in your ajax function needs to be of the form 'id=xxx'.,0
11427,try data: 'id=' + id .,0
11428,"the explanation here is that post data should be of the form a=b,c=d,... et cetera.",0
11431,hence you would need to do data: 'id=' + id .,0
11432,"if id=2 , then that will evaluate to data: 'id=2' , which is correct.",0
11433,"ultimately, as @stephen noted, it is better to use an object for the data field, as it is arguably more elegant.",0
11434,"data: {'id': id} should work as well, and you can add more variables in the future.",0
11435,just test in the first line of the code if the $elements arrays already exist.,0
11436,"then the second time the code runs, it just explodes the $elements array that was created at the top of the script.",0
11437,"if parameters are hardcoded, there is no use for the placeholders at all.",0
11438,"query caching is enabled by mysql by default, so, you have no worry about it.",0
11442,"if you are using pdo, you could do something like:",0
11443,"you could take the substitutions array and split it into two arrays, e.g.",0
11444,"as i read your post, you want anyone from the preg_match to get the desired page regardless of sessionid status, so you don't want to test sessionid first.",0
11445,"also when you get the variable, you must assign it's value.",0
11446,"and not the value, returned by isset function:",0
11447,"because you access $_get[""page""] as query string in php file .",0
11448,so it should be set in link so that it doesnt become blank in php file.,0
11449,in your case $page is always blank as its not defined .,0
11450,"turn error_reporting(e_all) always in development mode to see errors,warnings,notices.",0
11451,"you explode the string based on the space character.you then ""pop"" the last element of the array into $last.the remaining members of the array are then imploded, using the space character as the ""glue""",0
11452,you can learn a whole lot more from php.net .,0
11453,it has a lot of examples to go with it.,0
11455,that includes parameters added by things such as mod_rewrite .,0
11456,"if you need specific parameters then index $_get[] appropriately, otherwise live with it.",0
11457,"i'm not sure what you mean, but if i have understood properly, both files are being called by an js script using ajax.",0
11459,"anyway, i'm pretty sure that the second file is being downloaded before the first one.",0
11460,"something you can do to workaround this is to abstract both session_start() and the $_session['myvar'] variable declaration in another file or in the top of your current file, for example in a file called 'session_init.php' it should look like this :",0
11462,now $_session['myvar'] should be accessible in both files as long as you declare session_start() at the top of each file.,0
11463,remember that is not a good practice to nest ajax petitions.,0
11464,"also you can take a different approach to send the data trough the files, for example, sending the value of 'myvar' as a parameter on the ajax request.",0
11467,"the problem you're having is that when 0.01 is cast as an integer it is rounded (to 0), which is loosely equal to null , you need to use floatval() and use an exact-comparison using === like so: floatval($_get[""nearkm""]) === 0 .",0
11472,when using two mysqli_query calls you should take a look at mysql transactions .,0
11474,this will help you to avoid sql injection.,0
11475,"since the formsubmitted is not present inside the form the values is not set for $_post['formsubmitted'] , so the if part of your if statement is never executed.",0
11476,when passing data to the view (template) you pass it as an array.so you view should be:,0
11478,not transforming the array into an element of an other array in order to perform a print_r...,0
11479,"contrary to other answers, i think you want to use ""or"" in your query, not ""and"":",0
11480,replace other_column with the name of a second column.,0
11481,you can keep repeating the part i added for each of your columns.,0
11482,"note: this is assuming that your variable $searchterm has already been escaped for the database, for example with $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($searchterm); .",0
11485,"also, what is wrong with the line of code you mentioned?",0
11486,it should work as far as i can tell.,0
11487,you can find the invocations here and here .,0
11488,(and here the type is put into the extended_value of the opcode.),0
11489,"if you look at the full opcodes , you'll see those constants as 1 ( zend_isset = (1&lt;&lt;0) ) and 2 ( zend_isempty = (1&lt;&lt;1) ) in the ext column.",0
11492,"second, if you don't have anything in $_post['search'] , then $searchq is never initialized, and you have nothing for your foreach loop.",0
11493,"second and a half, if you do pass in a $_post['search'] , but no results are found, you have $searchq as a string, so when it hits the foreach loop, it's not something foreach can use.",0
11494,"(honestly, your variables shouldn't do double duty like that, where you have $searchq as a string in the preg_replace and then use it as an array if there are search results.)",0
11495,"so, you're possibly not actually getting any results, so your while loop might never do anything, and therefore, $searchq is not an array that can be looped through with foreach.",0
11497,"however, if you have a logic to generate the groups, you should also be able to turn the value into the appropriate group again, using the very same logic, but reversed.",0
11498,edit: you could also pass the group as a prefix of the value.,0
11499,"there is a problem that not in or in work without """" in bracket () so you have remove """" from query like implode before query and store it in variable and pass string in query (in not in bracket).",0
11500,"i tried with your query it works fine,",0
11501,"you ought to both specify a suitable html type, e.g.",0
11503,"or you can use an array, but then you can't easily use implode since you will only gather the values , not where they come from, so you would need a cycle:",0
11504,it seems that your problem is you don't know what key the user is going to type in for the $_get parameter.,0
11505,"so, you can directly loop through $_get like this:",0
11506,"now, if you only want the first get parameter, you can use array_shift() , like this:",0
11508,"workaround :just edit the back-end and if there is no data for params or it is not an array (null, empty whatever ..) just assign an empty string to it:",0
11509,"update: i did few tests and it seems there is no way to put ""nothing"" in the request ussing a form or ajax.",0
11510,"0 , '' , null are valid values for the $_get but empty array is not even created.",0
11511,"so to answer your question, it is not possible to get empty array value from the front-end.",0
11512,use !empty() instead of isset() .,0
11514,"you could use empty() as well, but due to empty('0') yielding true you would need an extra condition leading to more cumbersome code.",0
11517,"everything looks ok. check you form again, and make sure the name attribute is correct.",0
11518,"also, if you are typing in the name on the search form, make sure you are taking care of the case sensitive.",0
11519,the name should match the name in the database.,0
11520,"or if your $_session['cart'] is an associative array, you can use json_encode function.",0
11521,"edit: for example, if your $_session['cart'] is an array like below:",0

11525,"btw, you will not be able to associate user id back to session, so it is better to save whole cart in database or cookie",0
11527,"you somewhere assign a variable by reference to your session, you can see this with the &amp; character in your var_dump :",0
11528,"a reference in php means, that in your case $_session['email'] has become an alias for some other variable.",0
11529,"if that other variable is changed, $_session['email'] will change as well as it's only an alias.",0
11530,2) another is you can use preg_match() you can achieve it.,0
11531,3) if you are getting it in url then get it using $_get['trackingid'] .,0
11532,"read the whole file, then use the explode function as follows to split the results string on | characters.",0

11535,"then, you should be able to check $results2[1] , and it will be true if radio button 1 was selected.",0
11536,(1) you are missing the name attribute in your checkboxes.,0
11537,(2) you are missing the closing &lt;/form&gt; tag.,0
11539,"also, i don't see why you are connecting to your database on the initial page load.",0
11542,"instead, the mysqli or pdo_mysql extension should be used.",0
11543,see also mysql: choosing an api guide and related faq for more information.,0
11544,you can iterate the arrays and compare each 1 dimensional array.,0
11549,i think that you should first explode using '\t' as delimiter to get the substrings separated by \t (name|code|email|designation|number|salary|age)and then explode each substring using '|' as delimiter.i wish that can help you,0
11551,"if you want only the last five, here's the modified statement",0
11554,"and then in the php script you can access $_post['medicine_name'] , $_post['quantity'] , and $_post['price'] .",0
11556,this solution will work if you want to use the &lt;br&gt; whenever the key is divisible by 10.,0

11561,"if an array was submitted in the url, then when retrieved via $_get , it will be a php array rather than a string that looks like a serialized array.",0
11565,it's because you're not using the correct regular expression.,0
11566,is there a reason you can't use explode() ?,0
11567,"regex is problematic, overly complicated at times, and much slower.",0
11569,your print_r($_get) is not querying / getting anything.,0
11570,you need to specify what $_get is looking for.,0
11571,"in your case, your url has the token and tokenid parameters.",0
11572,so you would need to $_get['token']; and $_get['tokenid'];,0

11606,"also, you are probably getting the division by zero warning because $count or $limit is returning 0.",0
11607,"i have on some old sites still old mysql and is working, but i suggest you as @matu to start using mysqli or pdo.",0
11608,you can find an answer to this here: set theory union of arrays in php,0
11609,by expanding on your current method.,0
11610,you can call array_unique and sort on the resulting array.,0
11611,"i note that most of the rest of your code uses the oo syntax for mysqli, which means that the connection variable is specified as the object name.",0
11613,"not tested, but this is to give you an array where the key is the category and the value is an array of catgories under that category (which in turn could each be arrays, etc)",0
11615,"you don't need to use array_push, since you're only adding one element to the array.",0
11616,you can save the overhead of calling a function by using the syntax:,0
11617,my answer depends on the necessity of the variables saved from the database.,0
11618,"in your supplied code, you're only using the id and tag values from the database in the nested foreach loops.",0
11619,"if this is this case, then you can simplify your arrays so you can use implode() on a new tags array.",0
11620,"i have not tested this since i do not have your database schema, but i believe it will work.",0

11625,"load http://example.com/include/version-3/css/style.php in your browser and see the generated code, rather than possibly relying on styles showing up in your html.",0
11626,you can use php's array_reverse to solve your problem.you can do it like this:,0
11627,"by the way, storing the $id in $_session won't work - there is only one $_session per web session, and since you are listing different jobs, $_session['id'] will contain the last $id .",0

11641,"after some communication to find out what you want to achieve, here's my answer, which would be too long for a comment.",0
11642,you basically want to check if any item in your array in not yet stored in your db.,0
11643,if you would have been following psr-1/psr-2 code formatting you would have seen that all curly brackets match properly as @hannan said in the comments of your post.,0
11644,below is your code indented using phpstorm set to psr-1/psr-2 formatting.,0
11645,"(note: i am not saying you must use psr-1/psr-2, just saying you could)",0
11648,"in php, your code will throw a fatal error on execution.",0
11649,"which looks something like this(removed a ; from working code, styling by xdebug ) this is of course only if they are part of the code, so when they appear in a string and one is missing, there will be no fatal error.",0
11650,"otherwise you can keep it as a string, and explode it.",0
11652,"if you want the parameter to contain an array, you need to use array notation, as in keywordbox[]=computing&amp;keywordbox[]=finance .",0
11657,you could alter your output so that instead you have array keys like selectvalue_2_1 .,0
11660,then you can continue with your current code using the clean string:,0
11661,"below is another one, which is more interesting, because in this case, strstr() is the winner:",0
11662,"this means it can really depend on ""environmental circumstances"" , which are sometimes hard to influence, and can change the result of ""micro optimization tasks"" like this, in case you are just checking whether a string exists in another one or not.",0
11665,"i miss look on your code, since it is mess, but disregard the mysqli and mysql thing, you want to show how many student in the teacher's classes.",0
11666,the best way is to use a second element.,0
11667,your code would look like this:,0
11668,"on the next page, you can now use $_post['ordernumber'] .",0
11670,uptdate instead of the for loop you can try and print_r($result['calls']['call']) .,0
11671,there you should see what your single call array looks like.,0
11672,well ... wi-34788 ticket looks very similar to what you are asking here.,0
11673,it was marked as duplicate of some other ticket ... which is now implemented in phpstorm 2017.1.,0
11674,possible issue is: that module declares not just $_request and alike but some other global variables as well which you may want to use in your project (check here what exactly is declared in that module: https://github.com/jetbrains/phpstorm-stubs/blob/master/superglobals/_superglobals.php ).,0
1,"note: in_array performs a linear search of the array contents, which might not be the best way to go if one or more of the following conditions are true:",1
18,"here is the link for the escape string, but you may want to consider the best alternative, and that is to paramterize the inserts",1
29,"please discontinue the use of mysql_* , it is no longer secure or safe to use, and there are much better alternatives.",1
30,i would suggest mysqli_* or pdo .,1
31,use either $_server['http_referer'] or have a hidden post value sent with the form to identify the page or form sending the data.,1
33,you can also then use $_server['request_uri'] to get the remainder of the url.,1
38,i also will note that you should use prepared statements with pdo or mysqli as it is better protection than using mysql_real_escape_string.,1
43,"session_start(); shouldn't be in your if condition, it has to be at the beginning of the script and always launched",1
73,"in php, preg_match will return 1 if the match succeeds and 0 if it fails.",1
89,"this uses mysqli and prepared statements ( for security ), instead of the depracated mysql extension ( in php 5.5 )",1
117,"sidenote : this( mysql_* ) extension is deprecated as of php 5.5.0 , and will be removed in the future.",1
119,switching to preparedstatements is even more better to ward off sql injection attacks !,1
128,you need to look into mysqli or pdo to sanitize your input...,1
186,"also, as a side note, every line in php needs a semicolon ; at the end of it.",1
209,"pdostatement::execute() only returns a boolean indicating success or failure, so your variable $num is not what you want to fetch from.",1
220,"sql injections are prevented by parametrized queries (a must-have this day and age); and html injections are prevented by htmlspecialchars() method, which should be called right before outputting the string to the user .",1
221,don't store encoded strings in the db or (even worse) - encode them as soon as receiving them.,1
246,"just a sidenote: mysql is deprecated, i would advise using mysqli or pdo",1
260,put session_start(); at the top of your php file.,1
265,in order to have access to the session array you must call session_start(); before accessing the $_session array.,1
266,remember to only call session_start only once per php execution.,1
268,you can check if the $_session array is set to know if the session has been started,1
317,"you don't escape the values, therefore open an sql injection.",1
329,"for a shopping website it is really important that the website will load as fast as possible, so that the customers enjoy shopping and staying on the site.",1
355,"instead, you should use the correct function (such as htmlspecialchars or mysqli_real_escape_string ) to escape the input before you use it.",1
430,"there are a number of problems with the way in which you're attempting to insert the data, but i believe the reason that you're not having any output is because standard mysql commands are deprecated as of php 5.5, and removed as of php 7.0. instead, you should be using mysqli, or preferably, pdo.",1
433,"pdo is more secure, but harder to learn, and not all web hosts support it -- make sure to check with your hosting provider!",1
435,"without using a prepared query, you're leaving yourself vulnerable to sql injection.",1

453,"if you really dont want to reload the whole page, the only way to do it is to use an ajax request to a page where your php code is.",1
462,php's built-in file function can get file contents into array.,1
495,php://input is a read-only stream that allows you to read raw data from the request body.,1
496,"in the case of post requests, it is preferable to use php://input instead of $http_raw_post_data as it does not depend on special php.ini directives.",1
514,array_push is a built in php function to add an element to the end of an array.,1
515,"i think you're looking for array_pluck , which is a laravel helper function to pluck a specific key from all the items in an array of arrays or array of objects.",1
522,you should look at moving to mysqli_* or pdo - mysql_* is being deprecated.,1
523,"you can do multiple queries in one call directly using mysqli, too; and they both make use of bound parameters, which helps you write more secure code.",1
528,"also, your current queries are ripe for sql injection, and myslq_ functions should not be used for new development.",1
531,"please don't use mysql_* functions, use mysqli or pdo instead.",1
540,note i am not getting in the details of the many issues your actual code has: first of all that is open to sql injections as many has already pointed out: take a bit of time to see what prepared statements are.,1
601,unchecked checkboxes don't get submitted to the server.,1
620,and you have to start_session() at the top of all your files.,1
654,"if you reload the page after submitting a form, it will keep the post data.",1
659,"obligatory suggestion , don't use mysql_* functions in new code .",1

706,"empty() returns true if the values is a empty string, while !isset() will return false.",1
710,you can use array_values (to get the values and ignore the keys ).,1
758,one advantage of using query parameters is you never need to worry about where you start and end your quotes.,1
759,"if you must interpolate variables into your sql, first make sure you protect the variables either by coercing the value to an integer, or else by using a proper escaping function like mysqli_real_escape_string().",1
760,don't put $_post variables directly into the string.,1
774,"you should use mysqli and not mysql as it is deprecated secondly, you should check if($results-&gt;num_rows === 0) and do your insert",1
804,and you can check this other post for reasons why mysql_* methods were deprecated: why shouldn't i use mysql_* functions in php?,1
819,"well, like the people asked in the comments; what is it that isn't working?i'd also suggest you use mysqli instead of mysql.",1
820,"if you still want to use mysql, just change ""mysqli"" to ""mysql"" and edit the connect along with the query.i would help you with your code but as you didn't really point out what's wrong i'll simply give you this example.",1
827,use !empty when it's important to know if the variable has be defined and is truthy,1
828,use array_key_exists when it's important to know if the key exists and the value is of no importance:,1
832,"note: mysql_* functions are depricated, use mysqli or pdo as an alternative.",1

1039,"when you set a php variable, it will disappear as soon as the php script finishes.",1
1098,and these days it's good practice to use pdo for database connections.,1
1103,mysql_connect does not return any object .... so it does not have any function or property that you can access using -&gt; operator .,1
1104,i advice you to start learning mysqli or pdo since mysql functions are retarded and no longer maintained,1
1109,"that being said, keep in mind that cookies are not safe , i.e., although most users won't see them, they are in no way secure against reading and/or writing them by user.",1

1197,you could use a debugger to examine these values before calling addfixtures() or examine them by adding simple echo or var_dump() statements right before the call.,1
1199,an array needs to be printed out using a special function such as print_r.,1
1202,"when you're debugging, you should use var_dump() .",1
1225,"but if you have a query that's basically the same and only uses different values in the where clause, you will get faster query executions by using prepared statements .",1
1226,note that it's bad practise to interpolate variables into queries due the risk of sql injection attacks.,1
1236,please do not use the mysql_* functions anymore and switch instead to the mysqli_ functions or pdo .,1
1250,you can use $_server['query_string'] to get the query string.,1
1262,"not exactly sure what you're trying to achieve with the rest of it all, but session_start() first is a starting point...",1
1264,to check whether a property exists in an object you can use property_exists() :,1
1270,some notes on the use of glob(); for opening files in case you may not be opening local files (it won't work on remote files): http://php.net/manual/en/function.glob.php,1

1820,to add another value of an array is to use array_push and to delete it you can use unset .,1
1821,before accessing $_session you first need to initialise session using session_start(); on the top of the page,1
1822,please note that sessions will not work if you use php from the command line,1
1830,don't use mysql_*() for new code - it's depracated.,1

1857,if possible you should move away from mysql_*** function in favor of mysqli or pdo.,1
1901,print_r() in pre tags is faster and more lightweight but this is amazing for debugging as it shows data types and also shows empty() variables.,1
1932,it is very important to use mysqli_* functions not mysql_* ones (they are deprecated) or even better pdo.,1
1934,newer version of php has deprecated mysql functions.,1
1952,isset() will return false if testing a variable that has been set to null.,1
1953,"also note that a null character (""\0"") is not equivalent to the php null constant.",1

2021,note php mysql_* functions have been depricated since version 5.5.,1
2025,"you just need to call session_start at the top of every file request you want to use sessions in, that's it.",1
2044,dont forget to use session_start() in top of your code in login.php and other file if you want to use $_session,1
2056,you can just use isset() to make sure the value is present.,1
2062,i think the value for the $_post['color'] should be read only after checking if its set.,1
2079,"however, you should do some cleaning on $_post[""submit""] since your code is open to sql injections.",1
2095,strpos returns false when the find_string is not found at all.,1
2103,"because $_post is a global variable of php, it exists in every php thread, so isset($_post) will return true , in your example the value of $_post is an empty array.",1
2134,you should mysql_real_escape_string each value in $_post['interest'] to avoid sql injections.,1
2150,unless you specify when the cookie is to expire it will automatically expire when the browser window is closed.,1
2151,the third parameter of setcookie() allows you to specify the expiration of the cookie:,1

2168,"however it is bad practice to use global variables in functions, just make sure you never overwrite the $dbcon variable, it might happen when using code from somebody else.",1
2180,so i'm going to go ahead and suggest you make a major change to your code: don't use mysql_* functions as they are deprecated.,1
2237,when you try to echo an array an implicit transformation from array data type to string data type is performed.,1
2238,because only strings can be echo ed.,1

2252,the function prepare() returns an object of pdostatement class.,1
2253,"as it says on the php manual, pdostatement :: execute() does not return results, it returns a boolean instead to indicate if the query was successful or not.",1
2285,"i will also add that you need to check the sql-injection and escape your fields or, better, use pdo and prepared statements.",1
2295,"the mysql_* functions will work, or better is mysqli, or even pdo etc.",1
2304,"don't use mysql_* functions, they're deprecated.",1
2317,"sidenote: you theoretically could with older versions of php, but as of php 7.0, the mysql_ api has been removed, so you definitely wouldn't be able to use it here if that were the case.",1
2318,"what you need to use here is a pdo prepared statement in order to escape the data, which is what you are looking to do here.",1
2319,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
2320,the reason why you must use array_merge and not array_unshift is because the latter only works on numerically indexed arrays.,1
2323,"note: when using array_merge the items with the same keys from the second array will overwrite the ones from the first one, so if 'front' already exists in $queue it will not be overwritten, but only brought to the front.",1
2332,"i would first say that you use pdo, and make your queries safer by using prepared queries.",1
2338,"after header(...); you need to throw in a return; or exit; to exit right there, otherwise it continues beyond that header.",1
2370,"if you need to check on each page whether there's still an active facebook session or not, look at fb.getloginstatus() in the javascript sdk, or make an api call to (for example) /me/permissions to check your access token is still valid",1
2378,"the leading concept in programming is ""don't trust user input"" .",1
2381,to escape a user input to prevent bad characters you can use htmlspecialchars or you can filter your get input with filter_input something like that:,1
2387,in_array — checks if a value exists in an array,1
2405,edit: you can add the filter_var command to strip bad characters and sanitize the input.,1
2411,for security reasons i also suggest you use pdo instead of mysql functions and $_post instead of $_request (in case you are not already sending your form per post).,1
2412,"you are looking for array_search which will return the key associated with a given value, if it exists.",1
2473,note: stop using deprecated mysql_* versions.,1
2478,"by default, forms submit data via get parameters in the url, which in php, and in this case, would go to for example $_get['post1'] .",1
2488,"by using a keyed array, there is no duplication and you can easily check how frequently a hashtag is used by just accessing $trending[$hashtag] .",1
2492,and also do not use mysql_ functions.,1
2509,"if you want to include the form name, use a hidden field like this inside the form:",1
2511,firstly use pdo or some php framework that has nice api to work with mysql.,1
2525,"you could muck with escaping the values, but a much better pattern is prepared statements with bind placeholders...",1
2534,another good habit is to check for errors after every call to pdo::prepare() or pdostatement::execute().,1
2541,"any approach that uses $_post values directly in sql is vulnerable to sql injection, though.",1
2547,"key() method would give the key of the current element of the array, so the argument for this method should be an array.",1
2548,if you are looking for all the keys of an array you can use array_keys .refer this for more details: http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-keys.php,1
2611,mainly the implode() function returns a string from the elements of an array.,1
2618,sidenote: learn about prepared statement because right now your queries are susceptible to sql injection attack.,1
2650,"to get variables from the query string, you need to use $_get .",1
2651,$_post represents data that is sent to the script via the http post method.,1
2659,you are open to sql injection and you should use prepared statements .,1
2661,"don't use mysql_ functions, they are not as secure and deprecated.",1
2662,"when doing selects for password and username, ensure case sensitivity by using binary and put limit 1 at the end, to ensure only 1 record in return.",1
2665,"you should use mysql and not mysqli since its deprecated you're accessing $row 's associative array keys, so you need the function to return associative array whild mysqli_fetch_array() returns numeric keys.",1
2685,"you use fetchall in you pdo statement, which will return an array.",1
2761,short answer: check to see if register_globals is enabled on your live server using var_dump(ini_get('register_globals')) or phpinfo() .,1
2762,"if register_globals is enabled, the preferable solution is to disable register globals—it leads to security problems and as of php 5.3 is deprecated.",1
2777,"by building sql statements with outside variables, you are leaving yourself wide open to sql injection attacks.",1
2779,"as a side note, it looks like you're using the deprecated mysql extension (and putting post values straight into a database query opening up the possibility of sql injection), i strongly recommend mysqli.",1
2793,"use mysqli_* or pdo , because mysql_* is deprecated and closed in php 7 .",1
2794,"your code is open for sql injection, you must need to protect with sql injection or just simply use prepared statement .",1
2796,"however, you really should move from mysql_* to pdo or mysqli.",1
2797,"i suggest to work with pdo , instead of mysql_... functions.not only because it's newer and object oriented but also because mysql... is deprecated.",1
2803,"even if you have used pdo , your code is still vulnerable with sql injection because you have not parameterized the query, query must be parameterized in order for the values to be cleaned.",1
2819,"at a minimum, wrap the $_get['name'] in a sanitizing function, like mysql_real_escape_string() to prevent sql injection attacks.",1
2820,"and then when you're outputting user-supplied data, make sure to wrap it in htmlspecialchars() to prevent cross-site scripting (xss) attacks.",1
2825,i've always stood by the idea that data should go into the database as raw as possible.,1
2837,"edit: on another note, it may not be a good idea to delete items from the array while you're looping over it.",1
2882,"$_post , being a superglobal, is always set.",1
2885,"when you try to store the form submitted values such as post or get, it is really a good habit to check if the value is really sent.",1
2896,i would encode the image before you insert into the database with base64_encode() .,1
2898,"$_post is an array, you access arrays with [], so:",1
2908,"if you are using htmlspecialchars, it is going to turn anything that is not alphanumeric into an html entity, so it will actually render the symbol in the browser rather than using it as markup.",1
2943,isset is only necessary if you're trying to work with variables that may not exist.,1
2947,isset only checks if a variable in instantiated.,1
2950,you might also want to have a look either at pdo and prepared statements that replace mysql_ functions.,1
2958,"however, as with any other time in programming, if you find yourself writting the same code over and over, you probably need to write an abstraction.",1
2972,"unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer,it's stored on the server.",1
2982,i highly recommend looking into using a pdo connection because it will be much more portable and parameterized queries pretty much eliminate security issues if used properly.,1
2992,you should start looking into switching over to either the mysqli_ or pdo api and with a prepared statement.,1
2994,this error means you have outputted something before calling the session_start function.make sure there is nothing above your &lt;?php tag and no outputs before session_start.,1
3001,"if you submit a form that has multiple select boxes, only the name of the checked ones will be in the $_post array.",1
3020,mysql is deprecated and can be vulnerable about sql injections .,1
3027,"if you need to encode all the symbols that are defined in html as ""character entities"" you can use the php function htmlentities() instead.",1
3037,you should probably take a look at using a library like pdo for your database queries as you're really exposed to injection attacks.,1
3038,this is because checkboxes are only sent if they are checked.,1
3050,the $_session variable is always set - regardless if you have initialized the session or not.,1
3053,"mysql_real_escape_string() should make sql injection attacks less likely however, it is strongly advised that you use the mysql database apis that are not deprecated such as mysqli (mysql improved) and pdo , which have stronger security in place.",1
3076,in order to make dealing with the session possible add session_start(); to the top of your script.,1
3077,the simple answer is that you need to put session_start() at the top of the script (and the top of any script that uses the session variables).,1
3082,"you should also look into binding parameters in queries, which would allow you to avoid having to think about escaping values before running queries.",1
3089,"fyi : please, don't use mysql_* functions in new code .",1
3097,"isset is used to check whether input you receive contains what you expect - this is a very, very loose definition and i wrote that trying to explain easily when you'd use it.",1
3102,"when you receive an input that user made via html form, you want to check whether certain values have been populated - in that case, you use isset .",1
3123,"these extensions have been removed in php 7. learn about prepared statements for pdo and mysqli and consider using pdo, it's really pretty easy .",1
3142,or even better drop the mysql_ lib (it was depreciated 10 years ago!),1
3143,first of all do not use mysql_* as ther are deprecated.,1
3145,"however, if you're using this with a get array, then yes; it would be best to use an isset() and empty() on a conditional statement.",1
3157,you can use strpos to search for an occurrence of a string within a string.and use an array for the search argument for str_replace.,1
3159,then you should use array_unique with the flag sort_regular to remove all duplicates and lastly json_encode it again to a json string.,1
3174,"if you are using php and mysqli, then mysqli::real_escape_string() will help.",1
3192,"if you would like to get form data you need to use the $_get , $_post , or $_request object(s), in your case you are using the post method in your form so instead of $domain use $_post[""domain""] :",1
3200,always use an isset construct to check whether the variable exists.,1
3233,"if the array is small enough, iteration will be more efficient.",1
3234,"but as the size of the array grows, it will becomes increasingly slower (and hence the function call will become faster).",1
3273,"if you are using a form to handle the user input without javascript intervention, don't worry about url encoding, that should happen automatically.",1
3302,"you can also use str_replace which should be faster then preg_replace , according to this entry.",1
3318,the alternative to mysql_escape_string in pdo is using prepared statements.,1
3319,you are secured you against sql injection when you pass parameters through placeholders in a prepared statement.,1
3324,it's a pretty common misconception that you have to manually serialize objects before putting them in session.,1
3325,"you can simply assign an object instance to a slot in $_session , and php will automagically serialize and unserialize it for you, between requests.",1
3355,"just beware : you have to think about escaping data before injecting it back into the form (see htmlspecialchars and/or htmlentities ) ; that is true for everything you get from the user (and, probably, for php_self too, i'd say) ;-)",1
3364,"also, as @damienlegros noted in his answer, you should always have the session_start() statement as early as possible in your code, i.e.",1
3393,"and also, as a side note: i highly recommend switching to mysqli from mysql, which is deprecated.",1
3396,for performance reasons you should probably select only the needed columns in the query.,1
3397,and it is heavily recommended to use pdo or mysqli instead of the mysql_ -functions as they are deprecated as of php 5.5 .,1
3399,you also probably want to look in to using pdo to prevent exploits better.,1
3405,"if you want to use the foreach structure, you need to ensure that the values passed to it are an array.",1
3449,"it is also overkill putting it inside php, so just leave it as html, but if you want to leave it inside php, than remember as said to take it out of the any condition/statement since we need to control its appearance from client side.",1
3463,"to pull your images and pictures from your database, a select query is what you are looking for.",1
3467,you should also consider using mysqli since mysql_* is now deprecated.,1
3469,it is safe to return user data based on a $_session variable if you are certain of its validity because you set it yourself in code.,1
3470,it is not safe to return data based on a session variable that you get from $_post .,1
3474,variables are not parsed by interpreter inside single quotes.,1
3477,"besides if you're using method=""post"" in your form, you can only get the inputs value through the $_post array.",1
3504,"when a form gets submitted via a post or a get request, what gets submitted are key-value pairs of data, i.e.",1
3563,the biggest drawback to persistent connections is that it limits the number of users you can have browsing your site: if mysql is configured to only allow 10 concurrent connections at once then when an 11th person tries to browse your site it won't work for them.,1
3597,"if your search string was more complicated, you could use a regular expression instead.",1
3601,always use mysql_real_escape_string instead of addslashes.,1
3634,"and finally: as people said in the comments, stray away from mysql_* functions, and look to sanitize the data going in and out of your database.",1
3679,"here is an example for using pdo to connect to a db, to tell it to throw exceptions instead of php errors (will help with your debugging), and using parameterised statements instead of substituting dynamic values into the query yourself (highly recommended):",1
3690,i strongly recommend to use mysqli with a prepared statement in order to avoid the risk of sql injection.,1
3693,and try to avoid using mysql_* functions due to they are deprecated.instead use mysqli_* functions or pdo statements.,1
3722,"if you are using a database at all to store this data before it is sent back to the browser, take extra care to make sure the database is properly encoding and retrieving utf-8 text.",1
3723,"if you were to use mb_strtolower , you could pass an encoding like: mb_strtolower($summoner, 'utf-8'); this properly handles special characters.",1
3724,print_r should be used only to print out an array in a human readable format (for debugging).,1
3741,you should have a look to foreach() learning to loop through arrays.,1
3742,"also have a look to empty() and isset() in the php documentation, those are your first friends for validating.",1
3747,"using pdo, you should look into prepared statements and binding parameters.",1
3766,"also, you should be passing the login name using a paramaterized statement to avoid an obvious security hole .",1
3778,"since mysql and its other components are depreciated due to security issues and performance, here is the usage of the mysqli class :",1
3786,"also, header() doesn't work if you've already produced output.",1
3802,"secondly, by putting $_post values directly in the query like that you are opening yourself up to all sorts of injection attacks.",1
3821,__file__ is part of the magic constants and will return the absolute path of the current included file.,1
3822,"$_server['script_name'] is a part of the predefined server variables , and will return the path of the script originally called in the server relative to the server root path.",1
3824,in your example you are using basename(__file__) which will in that case return the name of the included file.,1
3848,"an array when cast to a string will simply be output as the string ""array"" .",1
3849,"if you want to output each element in the array , loop through them or use something like join :",1
3852,"like other user have said, don't forget to add session_start() somewhere in the beginning of your code.",1
3853,"you should definitely consider to use another mysql extension as well, mysql_* is deprecated, use mysqli_* or pdo .",1
3854,it's also worth noting that the mysql_* set of function is now deprecated.,1
3868,well the problem is $_session value can be set and used on server side only.if you want this content on client side javascript you will have to send a request to php server for datacache value and then set it in your local storage .you may use ajax call like,1
3913,using pdo with prepared statements will take care of escaping your inputs :,1
3916,"php internally uses the equivalent of serialize / unserialize when you put objects inside $_session , so as long as you obey the rules (don't try to serialize resources, provide class definitions for unserializing) it all works automatically as you have already seen.",1
3967,"to check the encoding, you can use the file command in a shell.",1
3981,"try to usr mysql_fetch_array($sql,mysql_assoc) or mysql_fetch_assoc($sql) instead of mysql_fetch_array($sql) by default mysql_fetch_array return non associative array.",1
3983,"it's better for performance to use select column1, colum2 from table_name mysql module is deprecated.",1
3984,it's better to use pdo mysql module page mysql api comparison,1
4021,"basically, every page will start with session_start() to initiate the php session.",1
4028,"if you want to get all matches string, use preg_match_all() that find all matches.",1
4038,hint: stop using deprecated mysql_* api.,1
4039,use mysqli_* or pdo with prepared statements.,1
4040,mysql_* will be removed in the next version of php and prepared statements prevent you against sql injection.,1
4041,"also, the mysql_* extension is deprecated as of php 5.5 and is due for removal in future releases.",1
4042,it's recommended to use mysqli or pdo instead.,1
4046,seems like you forgot session_start(); on top of the code.,1
4048,"this ( mysql_* ) extension is deprecated as of php 5.5.0 , and will be removed in the future.",1
4049,"instead, the mysqli or pdo_mysql extension should be used.",1
4050,switching to prepared statements is even more better to ward off sql injection attacks !,1
4060,"when you include a script with include or require , that script has access to all variables in scope at the inclusion site.",1
4072,"you can't use mysql functions with a mysqli connection, and vice versa.",1
4073,always start session page with session_start().,1
4076,but you have to initialize session_start(); in all web pages where you have need to access that session variables.,1
4085,"sidenote: it seems you're saving plain naked passwords, if its available to you (php 5.5 or greater), i'd suggest you should use password_hash + password_verify to handle your login module for hashing those passwords.",1
4087,you can't compare a scalar variable to an array.,1
4106,both htmlspecialchars and htmlentities are subceptible to the infamous utf-7 problem.,1
4110,htmlspecialchars will default to utf-8 (in php 5.4/5.5) if you don't specify the third parameter so you should be safe even if you forgot to establish it.,1
4129,to prevent first order sql injection you can use pdo with mysql prepared statement.and when you want to display it to the html page use,1
4135,"note: if you use sessions, session_start() must be the first row because sessions can't be started after any headers sent.",1
4182,"also remember, session_start should always be the first line of the page in which you need to use sessions.",1
4183,"isset checks the variable to see if it has been set, in other words, it checks to see if the variable is any value except null or not assigned a value.",1
4184,isset returns true if the variable exists and has a value other than null.,1
4186,empty checks to see if a variable is empty.,1
4219,use the mysqli or the pdo extension instead of the old mysql extension.,1
4227,"the best thing is to never use client-provided data for opening files, but if you have to then make sure the path is clean and does not contain malicious stuff (such as a preceding slash or dot, etc).",1
4229,also its now encouraged to use mysqli not mysql.,1
4231,"also, if you're on php5 you should use a pdo object instead, for connecting to the database, and you shouldn't put vars directly into mysql queries (that allows sql parser to be injected with sql code from the user).",1
4234,"additionally, do prevent from sql injection, you should also sanitize your inputs ( $_post data) before saving them.",1
4237,"also, you may want to check $_server['http_accept_language'] instead of $_server['http_user_agent'] for the language of the user.",1
4243,"also, i hope you sanitize your _post inputs properly so little robert won't be able to harm your database.",1
4250,now of course you should upgrade your code to mysqli or mysqlpdo since the php mysql package is not supported anymore.,1
4255,you can also do a print_r($_session); to have a dump of this variable and see the content....,1
4270,you should also at least use htmlentities on the value that an input won't break your html:,1
4271,note that i have used htmlspecialchars to avoid your variable breaking the html.,1
4279,"remember that session_start has to be the first thing ever in your code, as it sets some headers.",1
4281,note: you may need to call bind_param() after setting the input variables rather than before.,1
4300,"so, to make this work you have to use either __dir__ or dirname(__file__) to find out where your script is located in the file system.",1
4305,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
4309,"use mysqli with prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements , they're much safer .",1
4310,note that you shouldn't be using mysql_* functions since it is a deprecated library.,1
4311,think about making the move to mysqli_* or pdo.,1
4313,you can't use values() and a selection together in an insert statement.,1
4361,"then, you have to switch to new mysql syntax for php, like mysqli or pdo.",1
4362,the mysql syntax you are using is deprecated.,1
4363,"that said, you should really consider both switching two either pdo or mysqli for your queries rather than the mysql extension and also looking into prepared statements and properly sanitizing strings, because you're very vulnerable to sql injections.",1
4383,"so after session_destroy() the cookie that holds the session id is still alive, and just the session file will be deleted.",1
4388,security concern: you are not escaping user submitted data when passing it to the sql statement opening you up to sql injection.,1
4395,"mysql_real_escape_string will escape invalid characters, so they can be used quite safely in a query.",1
4400,"and as a rule, you should never store passwords as plain text in a database.",1
4405,and i recommend you to use better approach to sql handling like using pdo extension.,1
4436,"you are doing an extra foreach , just check if the key exists in the array, you can do that using in_array .",1
4446,"i'd also recommend you use mysqli since mysql functions were deprecated in php 5.5.0, and it removed in php 7.0.0.",1
4476,you don't need to use session_start(); twice as that may trigger that the session was already started.,1
4478,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
4486,"for mysql, replace it with pdo or mysqli.",1
4495,filter_input() requires you to clearly specify the input type.,1
4496,"$_request is not clear about it, it contains input from various sources, allowing one source overwriting another.",1
4505,php sessions are implemented with cookies.,1
4506,"whenever you call session_start() , the response includes a set-cookie header which sets a browser cookie containing the php session id.",1
4541,"first of all: never use unescaped $_get , $_post , $_request , $_session .",1
4558,you have to call session_start() each time working with a session (not only when creating it),1
4585,also don't use mysql extension instead use pdo or mysqli.there are numerous things that are wrong with this script.,1
4598,you really should be using something like filter_var() or parse_url() instead of regexes for url validation.,1
4612,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
4629,"to be able to see database errors, one have to set pdo errmode to exceptions.",1
4630,"exceptions are better than regular errors in many ways: they always contains a stack trace, they can be caught using try..catch or handled using dedicated error handler.",1
4642,__construct and __destruct are called every time a script is ran with an instance of that object.,1
4660,also please stop using the old mysql_* functions.,1
4661,mysql_* functions will be deprecated in the future.,1
4664,"alternatively (and for your own good), you could use parameterized queries with pdo or mysqli .",1
4671,post variables are passed via the super global array $_post in php.,1
4680,the problem is that you're using array_pop on an index of the potentials array.array_pop is designed to pop the last element off the end of an array.,1
4681,array_pop() accepts an array as argument and it remove the last value from the array (returning it).,1
4709,"edit: php 5.4 will support array dereferencing, so you will be able to do:",1
4734,you can check email field is not empty and then you can use filter_var to validate provided email.,1
4752,you can set the value in $_cookie array by manual if you really want it in same page which's declared.,1
4757,"pdo, because it doesn't only support mysql.",1
4758,"whereas mysqli, obviously, only supports mysql.",1
4779,note - you are using the old obsolete mysql_* functions rather than the current mysqli_* functions (or the pdo equivalents).,1
4788,"by the way please, don't use mysql_* functions in new code .",1
4790,"learn about prepared statements instead, and use pdo or mysqli - this article will help you decide which.",1
4798,this can be done with a single line of code using the array_diff function which returns all items in the first array that are not present in the second array.,1
4806,"array_search() returns you the key already, or false if value is not found.",1
4821,and try to avoid using mysql_* functions due to they are deprecated .instead use mysqli_* functions or pdo statements,1

4914,"you can also use var_dump passing an array, it'll print the array's structure.",1
4928,also in your form you need to have value so there is data to get:,1
4930,you need to make sure you are doing mysqli for all your functions and not mysql interlaced with mysqli .,1

4953,"please check xss, sql injection attacks around the internet implement logic according to best practises, and validate/sanitize your data before process parameters into db or etc.",1
4972,remember to use stripslashes() to remove the quote escape on the values use addslashes() on.,1
4977,"the problem is that when you 'enter the values via the url', they'll end up in $_get instead of $_post .",1
4979,the action of the form is the address of the current script because you set it to $_server['php_self'] .,1
4989,you shouldn't use htmlentities when saving it.,1
4994,"when saving it, you need to sanitize for sql injection, so you mysql_real_escape_string it.",1
4995,"when displaying, you need to sanitize for xss, so you htmlentities it.",1
4998,"in addition to paolo's answer about when to use htmlentities() , unless you're using an old version of php, the correct way to sanitize for insertion into a mysql db is to use prepared statements which are part of the mysqli extension .",1
5013,you may need to add session_start() to the top of the file.,1
5027,it should be noted however @objective_d - you ought to use either mysqli or pdo as they offer far greater protection from the dreaded sql injection by utilising prepared statements.,1
5053,"first of all, use pdo or mysqli functions for database queries.",1
5084,"as a side note, mysql_query is deprecated, you should look into mysqli and prepared statements.",1
5116,you'll also want to add session_start(); to the top of the script.,1
5121,and mysql_* functions are depreciated they no longer supported by later versions of php.,1
5122,this mysql_real_escape_string() or mysqlo_real_escape_string() is not safe enough to prevent you against sql injections.,1
5123,solution is simple better start using mysqli prepared statements or pdo prepared statements.,1
5143,use mysql_fetch_assoc to get an associative array which will include the column names as keys.,1
5165,you need to call session_start() whenever you are using session.,1
5169,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
5174,"anyway, the mysql functions, you use, are deprecated.",1
5179,don't insert $_post data to the database directly.,1
5184,"note that isset() will return false if the key exists in the array, but its value is null.",1
5186,nb: it is better to use mysqli or pdo instead of mysql since mysql is officially deprecated since php 5.5,1
5189,@[niet the dark absol] is correct that you cannot interchange mysql_ and mysqli_ .,1
5257,use the mysqli or pdo libraries instead.,1
5305,note that pdo won't allow to escape table or field names.,1
5318,sessions are not shared between servers.,1
5322,"it is normally good practice to do all your database connectivity at the top of the page, then display the results.",1
5359,you could get the complete get variable with $_get then you have an array that you can browse with,1
5362,isset() will return true if the variable is set but empty (eg. '',1
5371,"if you want it to print as actual html, then you shouldn't use htmlspecialchars() .",1
5374,htmlspecialchars() will convert any special characters in the string to its associated ascii character code.,1
5375,of course you could add the trim() like echo trim($error) so there would be no whitespaces on beginning and end.,1
5376,"mysql is depreciated, you should use mysqli or pdo.",1
5380,"second, you should not be using mysql unless you are using an outdated version of php.",1
5389,"as others have already stated, you should be using the mysqli function set as opposed to the mysql function set.",1
5397,you should also rather use mysqli functions and not deprecated mysql functions and the better option will be prepared statements.,1
5405,"moreover, you shouldn't use mysql_* functions because are deprecated.",1
5407,"if you know both of the values are guaranteed to be strings, then == and === are identical since the only difference between the two is that === checks to see if the types are the same, not just the effective values.",1
5411,"so the first thing i'd recommend is to stop using the mysql_xxx() functions, and switch to using the pdo library instead.",1
5413,pdo allows you to use a feature called prepared queries allows the database to cache queries more efficiently if you to call similar queries repeatedly.,1
5423,also note that the mysql extension is deprecated (and probably unmaintained).,1
5477,"as someone said in updated version of php mysql_* function are deprecated you can use mysqli_* functions, your code is not working because you have closed your mysqli connection in mysql.php",1
5478,one thing that you need to seriously reconsider is using unsanitized data from $_post and $_session .,1
5480,"i would also look at migrating your code to use mysqli or pdo, as mysql is quite outdated.",1
5486,"even if you do all the above, as i have mentioned, your database, still be weak to mysql injections, therefore, you are better of learning pdo or mysqli",1
5495,also try removing the mysql_* functions and using mysqli_* functions or a pdo because the mysql_* functions are depreciated.,1
5496,"isset will return a boolen, not a string that you are expecting.",1
5497,use mysqli instead of mysql to prevent hackingand also validate the user input use htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars(),1

5515,but remember: cookies are saved local on the client pc.,1
5530,unless you are consuming large amounts of memory with the definition of a local variable there really isn't a need to explicitly unset them.,1
5559,"and secondly, try to use mysqli database extension instead of using mysql.",1
5560,mysql extension is deprecated from php 5.5 onward.,1
5566,"this part of the code will only execute only if this is set $_session['user'] , you need to start the session on the pages that you use sessions with session_start(); before your code.",1
5570,"if you want to match all occurrences of the expression, use preg_match_all .",1
5578,"first thing first to make sure that empty values are not inserted, you need to check if that value is set from the form then execute the query when the value is set, also you need to prepare your statements when using pdo, also don't directly enter you variables in your query use placeholders instead.",1
5580,"this is injection safe method with pdo, and i recommend you to use it:",1
5630,"you really should sanititze your user-input before using it in a query, otherwise your site is vulnarable to sql-injection.",1
5654,if you are not going to change to mysqli or pdo with prepared statements ( which mitigate against sql injection ) then at least ensure you filter any data received from your users - for instance mysql_real_escape_string offers at least some protection.,1
5669,you need to sanitize all user input before using it.,1
5673,"also, in sql queries, you need to escape the data or use prepared statements.",1
5691,"also, adopt what helion3 said and check that _post actually has keys/values before you assign it to the _session",1
5702,"if you are inserting into a database, then you should usually be handling your escaping using parameterized queries (via prepared statements) .",1
5708,so call session_start(); at the beginning of the script.,1
5709,that query is also unsafe because the value from the session inst escaped.,1
5719,isset() just checks whether the variable is null or not and won't throw an e_notice error if you accessed an undefined index in an array (unlike is_null() ).,1
5778,autoloading is by far the preferred way to deal with includes.,1
5796,"sanitization for mysql should be considered entirely separate from sanitization for web output, and you should handle them separately to avoid a lot of hassle.",1
5797,"htmlspecialchars($val) at output time will prevent any malicious tags from being rendered, because &lt; and &gt; characters are converted into their entity representations and not rendered as tag delimiters.",1

5804,"also, when you make an sql query, you should sanitize variables you pass to it.",1
5806,"also, just for future, it is recommended to use pdo because mysql extension is deprecated and will be removed.",1
5814,"i suggest you should use stripos , not strpos for your purposes, as it is case-insensitive and will also find words with uppercase letters, if it's something you might need.",1
5822,i use the php function isset() to check if a post was sent or not,1
5844,"if you want to know whether the array is defined at all, use isset($array) .",1
5845,"if you want to know whether a particular key is defined, use isset($array[$key]) .",1

5870,i advice you to use pdo or mysqli look this is deprecated .,1
5876,and for sure you have to call session_start() at top,1
5930,"when using double quoted strings, you don't need to concatenate variables.",1
5934,"rather than inserting values directly into the string, use a prepared statement.",1
5942,"to destroy all data registered to a session, then use session_destroy in this case the session variable still exists but empty.",1
5948,"note, (1) you are open to sql injection by using $_get values directly in your query, and (2) from the mysql_ doc - this extension is deprecated as of php 5.5.0, and will be removed in the future.",1
5949,"instead, the mysqli or pdo_mysql extension should be used.",1
5968,also you can put next array into that array :) it's called multidimensional array .,1
6016,"by the way, consider using pdo or mysqli for manipulating database.",1
6070,that being said: don't use the mysql_* functions anymore.,1
6076,"use mysqli with prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements , they're safer .",1
6077,"as escaping depends on the system you are sending the data too, my suggestion would be to use the functions provided by php, specifically created for each system.",1
6078,"or use prepared statements ( mysqli , pdo ) don't add backslashes yourself : why do that when proper and well-working (and well-tested !)",1
6085,you're also probably opening yourself right up to some sql injection vulnerabilities - check out pdo and prepared statements.,1
6086,"and if this is for an actual web application, start salting and hashing your passwords.",1
6100,"if you can use array keys immediately (without conversion), use isset() because it's obviously much faster than in_array() due to way keys are looked up and because it's a language construct.",1
6104,session_start() will need to be included to all the pages where you either want to store the session values or access them.,1
6112,"this is why you should be calling session_start() for all requests, and why if should be one of the very first things in your script.",1
6169,in most cases (it depends of php settings) the session will have limited lifetime.,1
6203,"the entire mysql_query api has been trashed, it's obsolete and the latest version of php no longer supports it.",1
6204,"you need to move on to something better, and i'd recommend pdo as a baseline.",1
6207,with pdo you can name your placeholders.,1
6210,"placeholder values will be substituted correctly, safely, and most important, consistently.",1
6228,"foreach creates a copy of each array element, so unsetting $media[$media_key] only unsets from the copy; and you want to unset from the original $data array:",1
6233,"if you need the keys from each result just loop over $results and for each $result get the keys, using the array_keys syntax.",1
6235,explode returns an array where all the items from the string are values and the keys are just numbers starting from 0. take this example:,1
6238,if you want to find out if a certain value exists in the array use array_search() .,1
6261,you can prevent htmlentities from double encoding by providing false as the fourth parameter.,1
6298,"also note that mysql_* functions are deprecated, use mysqli_* instead.",1
6313,"if you want replace a know, exact substring, you have to use str_replace instead.",1
6319,"standard mysql_ functions are now deprecated, and for very solid reasons.",1
6334,"you should validate the $email that you insert into the headers, or not insert any user input at all into the headers.",1
6338,you should use something like pdo to bind parameters to your sql query.,1
6363,first of all the way you store your credentials in cookies is very dangerous.,1
6379,you shouldn't store the password even if it is hashed in an cookie.,1
6420,"you can do this with pdo or mysqli , your current version of mysql is deprecated and strongly advised not to use it, instead look into mysqli and pdo which have methods in place for exactly what you want to do,",1
6436,but even better is to use prepared statements with query parameters instead of escaping and concatenating variables into sql query strings.,1
6442,"you have to use mb_strtolower for multibyte strings (this applies to many other string functions of php too, see manual ).",1
6443,"as explain in the docs , array_unique compares elements as strings by default.",1
6454,please be informed that mysql functions are deprecated and not recommended.,1
6472,the database usually returns an error if data could not be stored.,1
6477,advice: avoid using mysqli_* statement as they are deprecated in recent php versions.,1
6478,learn mysqli_* prepared or pdo and start implementing.,1
6500,"note that you will have to santise the value, mysql_real_escape_string is normally used to do this.",1
6501,finally the mysql_* methods are deprectaed and you really shouldn't use them.,1
6511,sidenote: learn about prepared statement because right now your queries are susceptible to sql injection.,1
6523,"however, you ought to use prepared statements in order to make your queries properly formatted .",1
6527,"i noticed that you're using mysqli to connect db, then you're using mysql for execute query, you should use same lib, try to execute your query through mysqli_query()",1
6555,you can use this code..dont use mysql and mysqli combinations.,1
6611,"for prevent sql injection first you need filter the input, second use pdo.",1
6615,"in this case, the best approach is using parametrized queries, instead of using concatenation when building sql queries.",1
6621,"for values which are expected to be a number (integer, float) - you can either use intval($var) for integers or floatval($var) for floats.",1
6622,edit: i forgot to mention: the best is to use pdo (php data objects) -> http://de.php.net/pdo,1
6625,it is also very suggested to use prepared statements .,1
6652,"note: the above example uses pdo, which you should really look at using, since the mysql_ functions are deprecated.",1
6654,use var_dump($_post['fruit']); to see your array structure and how you can access it.,1
6663,"in php, casting any string that doesn't begin with a number evaluates to to 0. the 0 exists in your array, so in_array() returns true.",1
6664,"if you don't want this to happen, set the third parameter for in_array() to true, so it performs a strong comparison (equivalent to === ) and consider the types, too.",1
6669,"so the answer is: no, the connections will not be shared between and re-used by the mysql extension and pdo.",1
6694,and lastly you shouldn't be using mysql_* you should use pdo or mysqli .,1
6700,the correct way to access post values is to use the predefined variable $_post (all capitals).,1
6701,i would also consider using the htmlentities function to sanitise the incoming data before you display it on your web page.,1
6703,it is possible to lookup for more than one string with str_replace like:,1
6718,"simple, non production code is not allowed on production ( var_dump , print_r , et al.",1
6734,use prepared statements (pdo or mysqli) to protect from mysql injection.,1
6746,"the mysql_* functions are deprecated and if i recall removed as of php 7, which means this code is not future proof beyond php 5x.",1
6753,"you have to start a session with session_start() before checking th session, and to make sure that the session has been opened with the correct name and value.",1
6761,"you also could use the mysql_real_string_escape (order of words might be off there).you should switch over to pdo and parameterized queries when you can though, how can i prevent sql injection in php?",1
6772,"i i completely agree that pdo is good choice to avoid sql injections but, you know at such situations you are unable to debug your queries.",1
6774,please stop writing new code with the ancient mysql_* functions.,1
6776,instead you should learn about prepared statements and use either pdo or mysqli .,1
6802,array_search returns false if $needle is not found.,1
6803,false casts to 0 when used as an integer.,1
6834,"you approach is wrong, you need to have session_start() at the very top of the page, than use a session variable like this",1
6841,"in php, once the script has finished, every memory that was allocated by that script is freed, so $calendar_id_val is no longer in memory.",1
6850,"note that the use of sessions is to be recommended, because sessions store the data server-side, whereas cookies are stored on the client's machine.",1
6865,if you're outside of a loop and you want to insert multiple items simultaneously then use array_push.,1
6872,"there is a function mysqli_connect() , which establishes a mysqli connection object in procedural (non-oo) code, as in:",1
6923,persistent connections for the mysqli extensions weren't added until 5.3 since they caused headaches before.,1
6942,"as has already been suggested, try using ""date_default_timezone_set"" and ""date"" to get the date in your local timezone.",1
6943,use mysqli instead of mysql functions as mysql functions are deprecated escape your strings!,1
6944,to avoid sql injection use mysqli_real_escape_string on anything that comes from the request,1
6952,as far as i remember the mysql is obsolete so try to use mysqli instead.,1
6958,you could use isset() to see if the checkbox has been checked.,1
6976,"additionally, look into using the mysqli library (or similar) and learn how to parameterize your queries so you can avoid dealing with sql injection later.",1
6989,there are tools like fail2ban helping to overcome compatibility issues between different firewalls keeping your php application portable between root servers.,1
6990,"fail2ban can scan all kinds of log files, even custom ones.",1
6993,"well, if you don't want xss problems, then using htmlspecialchars() is a good idea.",1
7004,"you should also look up functions for preventing email injection, and also run strip_tags on every post value to prevent xss attacks on your form.",1
7021,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
7036,"you can ""salt"" the hashes with extra data so if they are compromised, it's value cannot be found (try googling some simple hashed words).. i.e.",1
7038,the problem i was having was that if you check to see if a field in the form isset it will always be set once the submit button has been pressed.,1
7059,"do however note that all other variables must be escaped before appending them to the query, because one of them might contain a string that invalidates the query.",1
7073,you should also look the method prepare from pdo to properly set dynamic values in your query instead of building it by yourself.,1
7074,"edit : according to the php documentation on strings i'm wrong and you can interpret an array between double quotes, sorry for the confusion.",1
7114,"however - you shouldn't introduce parameters in this way, and the mysql_* functions are deprecated.",1
7155,"further, you should sanitize the input, like this:",1
7165,"as far as i know pdo is completely object-oriented, but you may want to look into mysqli which allows both procedural and oo styles.",1
7166,"at the start of each page, you should have a call to session_start(); .",1

7207,"in a web application, the only way to share information between users is to store that info, on the server!",1
7251,keep in mind that everything in php is case sensitive.,1
7301,make use of isset to check if a cookie exists and then try setting one.,1
7304,you may use addslashes() for entering apostrophe and as you have already said use stripslashes() for echoing.use addslashes() only if you want to add apostrophes for more escaping functions used mysql_real_escape_string,1
7316,session_start must be called before you read from -or write to- the $_session variable.,1
7322,"for more security use prepared statements.and check if $_post['username'] and $_post['password'] are set too (even if your input fields are ""required"")",1
7328,"but really you should use pdo instead of the deprecated mysql_* functions...google pdo, and learn to do prepared statements.",1
7353,"better yet, learn pdo with prepared statements instead of the deprecated mysql_ functions, which solves the issue of sql injection much better.",1

7435,mysql is deprecated and can lead you to a whole lot of trouble.,1
7440,"remember that each input's name directly corresponds to the post's array index when it is sent.to easier visualize what you are posting and how the data is sent through, you can do:",1
7455,"but there's also the advantage of array_push , you can use it to push multiple elements to an array:",1
7473,be sure to remember your session_start(); at the top of each page that uses the $_session variable.,1
7533,an array could be really helpful when it's a dynamically created form.,1
7540,third is a suggestion to use $_request[] when you are not sure about the get or post collections.,1
7548,"now, implode() has to make a string, so it converts each item in the array it's given to a string before proceeding.",1

8467,isset() returns either true or false if the post variable exists or not.,1
8475,this is a strong argument in favour of pdo because products based on it are likely to run faster in more environments.,1
8487,"if you do not want the webpage to load, when submitting, you'll need some javascript.",1
8494,you can use (in_array) function to check if var in array or not,1
8505,"if you are using session_start(); correctly (at the begining of your document), your code is fine.",1
8508,"also as a side note, you should use mysqli instead of mysql",1
8513,"$_get purpose is to contain url parameters, if they exist (to be precise, a get method form will pass all its parameters via the url).",1
8544,"use prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements , they're much safer .",1
8546,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
8550,the use of htmlentities assumes that the contents of the review column does not contain any html markup that should not be escaped/encoded.,1
8553,"using prepared statements removes the need to sanitize user input, as harmful input is not substituted into the query directly.",1
8554,"there are some good tips for using prepared statements in many different scenarios, as well as towards the bottom, there is an explanation on how prepared statements prevent sql injection.",1

8606,avoid sql injection by escaping your variables.,1
8607,"is_float() checks the type, not the content of the variable where is_numeric() only checks the value.",1
8620,"whenever data is coming from user, sanitize it(take special attention if its storing in database.).",1
8634,you also should move away from mysql_ as the mysql api is deprecated.,1
8637,"for debugging purposes, i suggest you print out the array if you're having trouble in the future using: print_r($auser) .",1
8641,"to prevent sql injections and make escaping input easy, use prepared statements .",1
8642,"if you don't want html for an input, you can optionally use strip_tags to completely remove the html from the input and then validate it further.",1
8683,the pdo statement prepares the query to avoid sql injections.,1
8716,sort() returned values are true or false .,1
8730,"isset checks if a value is set and returns a boolean, so $num1 and $num2 will be either true or false.",1
8734,"the problem with $_request is that if there are variables of get, post and/or cookie, one will override the other in that superglobal.",1
8735,it's semi-predictable what values you end up getting if you try to access $_request .,1
8736,"the only thing is that $_request will contain values passed in get and post commands, and cookies values.",1
8737,"so if you want to process only values passed in the url, you will probably want to use $_get ...",1
8745,i'm not going to tell you how to do that using mysql_ because only a fool uses mysql_ these days.,1
8746,"please, please use pdo or mysqli_ .",1
8768,"i know you weren't explicitly asking about security, but escape your user fields!",1
8769,you should never ever directly use $_get or $_post variables in your queries.,1
8783,"try avoid using $_request for things like sending e-mail.you would think that a form has to be submitted in order to send a mail.but with $_request , you can also open the page directly, as in domail.php?your_name=somename&amp;your_email=someone@example.com",1
8788,"then you should note that even with mysqli::real_escape_string() , it's not secure against sql injection, and that you should use parameterized queries.",1
8793,you should use functions like password_hash() / password_verify() to properly and securely store your users passwords.,1
8820,i think you mean $globals (notice the s) which is a suber global variable and therefore can be accessed from anywhere in the php script (also from within functions or methods).,1
8852,"first, you should know that the mysql extension is deprecated, you should use mysqli or pdo_mysql .",1
8865,"if you persist, please use mysql_fetch_assoc() instead of mysql_fetch_array(), this is lighter and you get what you want.",1
8894,no sanitation is necessary for pdo because it uses prepared statements.,1
8917,"when outputting to html, use htmlspecialchars to avoid html injection or plain syntax problems and afterwards use nl2br to format line breaks specifically for html.",1
8919,"additionally you're using backticks around the value you're searching for $_session['user_id'] backticks are for column names, you should use ' around values.",1
8920,suggest you to use pdo http://in1.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php or mysqli extension because php 5.5 wont be supporting mysql extension any more,1
8932,"also, i suggest you to test if the variable is not empty, because fields like ' input text ' will always exist even if it is empty.",1
8933,you can use empty function to test if it exists and not empty,1
8938,use of old mysql_* php functions is discouraged.,1
8942,"and consider using mysqli or pdo (and use parameterized queries), as mysql_* are deprecated!",1
8943,"to me this has to be updated to type : 'post or get' because php's $_request handles both, so you can change your type to this:",1
8949,the problem is codeigniter does not accept array of pairs when unset session data .,1
8956,"they behave differently because in sort the $myarray variable is passed by reference, meaning the variable itself is operated on whereas in array_reverse() the variable is not passed by reference.",1
8970,count() can only return the number of items in an object if the object interfaces with the countable interface which an undefined variable does not which is causing the error.,1
8981,"in the case of pdo::query() the return type is either pdostatement or bool, although the prototype in the documentation says something different:",1
8987,pdo::exec() returns the number of rows not an object that you can fetch on.,1
8995,"yes, shared state is usually stored in a database, although state may also be stored in the local file system.",1
8998,"regarding your second question, pdo protects you against sql injections.",1
9036,i'd use isset() instead to properly check if the form was submitted or not.,1
9056,"of course, you have to add session_start() at the top of the page!",1
9076,and this code is secure from myql-injection thanks to pdo and the power of prepared statements.,1
9077,"it is worth noting that you should pass a charset=utf8 as attribute, in your dsn as seen above, for security reasons, and always enable pdo to show errors in the form of exceptions.",1
9079,"but, using prepared statements as shown above will always be safer, than using any of the functions that start with mysql_",1
9104,"back to injection protection... to protect against injection without moving to prepared statements via mysqli or pdo, use mysql_real_escape_string() in place of htmlentities() ;",1
9109,session_destroy will delete your complete session.,1
9110,"if you want to delete particular session value use unset function, somewhat like this",1
9124,"and remember, a get request should be used to retrieve, and a post request should be used to create.",1
9135,joining up raw bits of text and passing them on to your database to process is not a good idea.,1
9156,"as pointed out in the comments, you really should start using mysqli instead of mysql.",1
9168,"so, first of all, correct (see the quotes in array indexes) and escape (as @footy already told you) your query [insert ""better using prepared statements"" phrase here]:",1
9202,in the php pages you need to access session variable add session_start() after the starting &lt;?php code,1
9204,"also, another option is to switch to pdo , which is a bit nicer, as it supports named parameters and more databases.",1
9233,make it a goal mitigate the pain of making changes in the future: a global is dangerous because it's hard to manage in a single spot.,1
9248,"if something fails, then there most certainly was an error.",1
9264,also your code is subject to sql injection - use mysql_real_escape_string before the query:,1
9265,"so as long as you don't eval() user input, you're safe with sessions.",1
9303,also you could install the php module xdebug which could modify the output of var_dump for better readability: http://xdebug.org/docs/display,1
9321,"second, you need to check for errors after every prepare() or execute() :",1
9356,"with isset() you check if the certain $_post parameters are set, but not validated.",1
9382,"better is to use pdo as mentioned above, mysql_ can be used ""safely"" on &lt; php 5.5.",1
9407,"mysql_query is deprecated , please consider either mysqli or pdo.",1
9425,"if you send text, but the column is int then mysql will attempt to coerce the data into int .",1
9428,bindparam accepts the value by reference .,1
9439,the use of pdo is much better and safer.,1
9473,your session_start(); should come at the beginning of the file in login.php .,1
9480,the mysqli extension does support mysqli_multi_query() but i still recommend doing one query at a time.,1
9505,warningisset() only works with variables as passing anything else will result in a parse error.,1
9506,for checking if constants are set use the defined() function.,1
9523,"move to mysqli or pdo_mysql , for new projects.",1
9534,"you're better off using pdo or mysqli prepared statements you should always read the manual - password_verify() , it states clearly that you compare the ""user inputted password"" against the hashed version which is stored in your database.",1
9563,"i would also like to point out the use of prepared statements here, as they are the only way to properly defend against sql injections .",1
9565,you should start session before any output.change your code to:,1
9574,"for extra safety, you should store the remote address that was used to login, and compare it on each page load.",1
9593,"you should use isset to check if a variable is set, that's what it is for.",1
9608,array_diff returns elements in the first array that are not in the second so have $b before $a the arrays contain other arrays so you probably want to use array_column to get specifically the teacher_name column,1
9630,"make sure you're calling session_start() , always and only once (ie.",1
9635,i would recommend to go to updated and newer mysqli as mysql will probably disappear in some time from php at all.,1
9643,"one of the advantages of pdo is that it allows parameter binding, which protects you from sql injection.",1
9647,use array_slice() to get part of an array.,1
9649,call htmlspecialchars() on any untrusted strings you are sending to the browser as html.,1
9666,"secondly, codeigniter does not utilize php's native $_session , they implement their own.",1
9695,your present code is open to sql injection because you are not escaping any data input .,1
9701,"unfortunately, array_walk_recursive is designed so, that it can't edit keys .",1
9705,and use pdo or mysqli as suggested in the comments.,1
9706,"php's isset checks to see if the referenced variable has a value assigned - if it does, echo it.",1
9734,"all i needed to do was add make sure the session_start() was at the start of each page that used it before the output, other wise it wouldn't work.",1
9736,also use mysqli instead of mysql to avoid sql injection .,1
9815,mysqli comes with an object-oriented interface out of the box.,1
9823,"i haven't use htmlentities before, but it seems like a bit more robust version of urlencode (which i use a lot).",1
9827,"your code is prone to sql injection , you are still using mysql even though it has been deprecated, you should use either mysqli or pdo with prepared statements.",1
9846,"php treats empty or null variables as ""false"" so you don't have to check the $_post variables again, after you assign them to your local variables.",1
9887,"first, the mysql api you are using is deprecated and will eventually be removed.",1
9889,you must then bind the paramter to your select statement.,1
9890,here is why it would be best to switch to mysqli or pdo because the mysql_* functions in php do not support prepared statements and parameterized queries.,1
9911,"mysql methods are depreciated in php, try to use pdo extension.",1
9933,another approach is to use array_key_exists to check for the existence of an array key.,1
9958,"if your other script happens to be using this word as a column reference, you will need to set it inside backticks, since key is a mysql reserved word .",1
9959,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help during production testing.,1
9966,"you won't be able to detect those changes until the next request for the page, when the browser will send the cookies again.",1
9971,you should not use mysql_ as it is outdated and will be removed in future versions of php.you should switch to mysqli_ or pdo .,1
10020,"better yet, learn pdo instead, as, unlike mysqli, it's already a ready to use database access class, with it you don't need functions like processrowset, for example.",1
10023,"the $_post identifier is actually an array, so the brackets should be square brackets.",1
10026,"also, if your users are logging out, you should also delete/invalidate their session variables.",1
10038,you need to pass pdo::fetch_assoc as parameter to be able to retrieve the data using named indexes.,1
10051,"and yes, you can use the variable directly in double quotes ( "" ) so that is why i did not use .",1
10057,only use htmlentities on strings as you echo them in html output (whether you fetched the string from a database or from some other source).,1
10061,"if you just want to protect you from sql injections, use mysql_real_escape_string for data that is used in mysql queries.",1
10065,"i may be wrong but i think the only way to unset the element in the array would be to look up the index that matches the value referenced by the variable you have, then unsetting that element.",1
10067,"however, keep in mind that this is not super efficient because each time you need to unset an element you have to iterate over the full array looking for it.",1
10078,"integer 0 is not strictly equal to boolean false, even though they have the same value of 0.",1
10097,"yes but htmlentities() is good for sending data as output to the browser, not for storing it into the database (as the data from the db might be used for something other than a web page).",1
10099,"in html, the value of the input will be passed to php script will be based on the name attribute.",1
10128,"instead of doing the session_start in each page, make a common.php file and include this file in all the required pages.",1
10129,"also, you need to make sure there is no white space before session is started, otherwise it would throw the header already sent error!",1
10133,preg_match() can only accept strings as pattern.,1
10141,do a var_dump() on your parent::$db and make sure that the object is not actually empty.,1
10164,"the dsn specifies (amongst other things) the hostname and database, using host and dbname elements respectively; whereas authentication credentials are supplied as subsequent arguments to the pdo class constructor:",1
10194,"also, as outis noted, keep in mind that you have the option of using prepared statements instead of just raw sql queries.",1
10202,you should be using php pdo library http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php or at least mysqli http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php,1
10232,"yes, since you’re putting it out into html you should use encode html’s special characters appropriately with htmlspecialchars :",1
10270,you should switch to mysqli_* or pdo since mysql_* functions are deprecated.,1
10280,array_filter is used for filtering out elements of an array based on whether they satisfy a certain criterion.,1
10283,"what you're looking for is array_map , which modifies each element in an array by running the callback over it.",1
10290,"i can see that the timeout happens while using your links, though i think the problem happens somewhere else.",1
10295,you shouldnt use the mysql_* functions in php anymore as they have already been removed from php7 and will not return from what i understand.,1
10298,"you call session_destroy() the user deletes the cookie from their browser the session expires based on the session expiration time defined in php.ini a new page is visited but the session_start() command is not called (once session_start() is called, then the session will be restored, bringing any $_session[] variables along with it)",1
10305,"not only are mysql_ functions deprecated and no longer being maintained, partly due to the security risk they allow by the use of sqlinjection, they also lack also object oriented capabilities.",1
10311,"if you just want a list of the names of the variables, just do var_dump(array_keys($globals)) .",1
10320,"$_post or $_request will work, although the latter may not be wise to use because depending on the php configuration, it may include cookie values.",1
10322,"in particular, sql uses and rather than &amp;&amp; .",1

10325,"if you were using either the mysqli extension or pdo, you would have prepared statement functionality available to you, which you should use instead.",1
10369,"use mysqli with prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements .",1
10400,inserting into the database could be much easier and safer using prepared statements.,1
10416,there are not any predefined session variables (try doing a var_dump($_session) if you want to check for yourself).,1
10423,"you use session_start(); at the beginning of each file that you want toaccess the session, and you can retrieve that data again.",1
10434,you should also be safely binding your user-input values to the queries to prevent sql injection and fully utilize the pdo library,1
10437,one nice feature of pdo is that the pdostatement implements the traversable .,1
10477,"and pathinfo is probably better to get the file name extension, so:",1
10479,"the other good news is, php got a builtin function to search whether a value exists in an array of values ( in_array ):",1
10518,"if you try to find a string from another string, you can strpos() .",1
10522,then you can use session_destroy(); to end their session.,1
10537,"to create an an array, you need to declare it using array() feature.",1
10571,variables from an html form passed as part of the url get put into a $_get array by php.,1
10590,"furthermore, i don't think you should be adding slashes to the content and directly insert the values in a query, instead consider using parameters.",1
10591,read up on php data objects (pdo: http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php ) which is a very nice and safe (if used properly!),1
10593,magic quotes have been deprecated for a long time.,1
10627,"you can use urlencode , this will convert any spaces to + .",1
10633,your code would not be considered insecure but you really shoud ditch the mysql_* library in favor of pdo or mysqli and use prepared statements where user input is needed in the query.,1
10642,"also, a better way to display the contents of your array is with print_r or var_dump .",1
10655,htmlentities() is not a guaranteed way to build legal xml.,1
10667,you need to have a try block before you can add a catch block.,1
10670,"you need to learn about sql injections and also about securing your passwords, use mysqli prepared statements / pdo what ever you find easy to learn",1
10698,first of all you should not use the mysql_* functions of php anymore.,1
10703,"strpos tells you the position of the search string if it's there, and false if it isn't.",1
10706,"your code is subjected to sql injection attack, as you directly allow post values to be inserted in your query.",1

10733,"to change the id of the body dynamically using jquery (which is the easiest way), you can do",1
10735,also you should format all strings with mysql_real_escape_string() as this prevents hackers being able to attack your database by passing sql in the string.,1
10739,"try using mysqli instead of mysql (depreciated) in php, you can also use pdo, however pdo is not as comprehensive and upto date as mysqli, and due to this is slightly slower.",1
10740,"the only advantage of pdo over mysqli is that pdo also works with postgesql, so switching database engine is easier, however the sql between mysql and postresql differ slightly, so it's not that easy.",1

10751,"make sure that you call session_start() at the top of your page, before you have outputted any html to the page.",1
10757,1) stop using mysql_ functions and use only mysqli_ functions (or pdo ) .,1
10758,mysql_ php funtions are deprecated and no longer supported (and hasn't been for 5+ years!).,1
10774,"also, sending the secret $number through form is not nice, you might want to read about php sessions",1
10777,"if you're a beginner, please don't put effort in deprecated language-parts like the mysql_ extension.",1
10779,use mysqli or pdo with prepared statements and bind your inputs to parameters.,1
10781,"array_slice() always returns an array - if there are no elements to return for its given offset, array_slice() returns an empty array.",1
10808,use htmlentities to convert all applicable characters to html entities,1
10809,ajax is the best way to accomplish what you are looking for also your code is extremely vulnerable to sql injection i suggest doing your homework on pdo prepared statements to help safeguard against it.,1
10825,when you are using functions like mysql_select_db and mysql_query it basiaclly means that you are using a deprecated mysql style.,1
10830,use mysqli_* instead of mysql_* as it is deprecated.,1
10837,prepared statements (via mysqli or pdo) can be useful if you are doing lots of high volume queries that all use the prepared statement.,1
10838,"the prepared statements are faster, additionally you don't have to worry about things like escaping data with prepared statements but they take a bit of code overhead so for a simple app sometimes it's not worth using prepared statements and using the old mysql_* functions are easier for the intended purpose.",1
10839,pdo supports more than one database backend.,1
10860,i think you should store the username and password as it is and do htmlspecialchars only when displaying them.,1
10917,"if you want to debug php, i suggest you use var_dump (or print_r ), this will show you if you have an array or an object.",1
10918,"a javascript console will always show object, and is not very useful.",1

10958,"$_server is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations.",1
10960,and at the end include_once is added to eliminate duplication of included file.,1
10962,do note that you are using mysql which is deprecated so it is recommended to switch to mysqli,1
10979,you probably want to call session_start() before the $_session variable will be available.,1
10980,"note: mysql api is deprecated as of php 5.5.0. so, it's highly recommended to use mysqli api for newer developments.",1
10999,"mysqli_real_escape_string() is possibly doing the "" escaping "" as you require, however "" is adding slashes to my text "" is not what mysqli_real_escape_string() does.",1
11012,you have to start the session using session_start() .,1
11017,but note that the mysql extension is deprecated and should therefore not be used in new code.,1
11021,"this happens because when you don't fill anything in the fields, you receive an empty string.",1
11033,"another thing, don't use addslashes() to secure queries, but use your library's dedicated function, such as mysql_real_escape_string() for mysql.",1
11034,or better use query bindings with prepared statements and parametrized queries.,1
11055,"now, on your test.php file, if you add the session_start at the top of the page you can access that variable: $_session['id'] .",1
11085,try using print_r or die to debug the value of the variables.,1
11087,"also, if working with $_session variables, make sure to have session_start() on top of each page where you need to access $_session variables.",1
11129,using pdo or mysqli it is extremely easy to have your database calls throw exceptions so you will know exactly when and what goes wrong.,1
11150,only checked checkboxes are sent to the server.,1
11164,you are using array_push which adds elements to the end of the array.,1
11165,"you should be using array_unshift, which will prepend new items to the beginning of the array.",1
11171,"this works because array_unshift puts elements at the beginning of the array, therefore the new sub-array will always be element 0.",1
11213,"you need to put the url inside the action attribute that does the form processing, not the function:",1
11217,"but this is open to sql injection, another way to do safer queries is to prepare them:",1

11260,"finally, i wouldn't be doing my duty as a so answerer if i didn't point out that the mysql_xxx functions are deprecated and should not be used in any new code.",1
11281,note that the above doesn't check for bogus input (always a good idea to validate input server-side as well as client-side).,1
11282,"aside from that, mysql_* functions are deprecated, move to mysqli_* if possible.",1
11284,"and mysql_ functions has been deprecated since 5.5.0, you should port your code to pdo or mysqli , you'll find an excellent guide here http://wiki.hashphp.org/pdo_tutorial_for_mysql_developers",1

11293,instead use mysqli or pdo and utilize prepared statements .,1
11297,"but first; as others have pointed out and it's been said time and time again, the use of mysql_ is being deprecated and will be deleted in the very near future.",1
11298,therefore using mysqli_ and/or pdo is strongly and highly recommended.,1
11324,"you should also be using something other than mysql_* to interact with your database, for example pdo :",1

11341,"you want to compare elements of only one array, so you use usort .",1
11351,"also, you should validate your $_post variables (at least use mysql_real_escape_string , better use mysqli or pdo ).",1
11358,(+) there are libraries like htmlpurifier which allow you to only sanitize specific elements.,1
11360,way to treat them: escapeshellcmd + don't use user input for something like directory or filenames on your server!,1

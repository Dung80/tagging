28,sidenote : i've noticed you're still using the deprecated mysql_* extension.,0
35,the where condition is where you determine which rows are retrieved from the table.,0

95,"instead of using all those conditionals, you could simply do:",0
99,there is indeed no point in storing database credentials as class properties.,0
107,you cant then take that code and use it with code that relies on pdo.,0
112,"the php function isset returns a bool value, which you are testing against.",0
113,it is a boolean and not integer.,0

401,"so, what i do is check is $_post['id'] set, and then check is this variable is an array.",0
402,then i escaped all values of $_post['id'] and after that implode the array to the sql.,0
408,"i wrote the answer to show how easy it is to use pdo and retrieve results easily, in one liner.",0
409,that happens by outputting $value .,0

476,otherwise you'd have to fix the html somehow.,0
477,just running it through htmlentities as mentioned above will not work since it'll also escape all tag markers etc.,0
480,"once the class is loaded using an autoloader, unset() ing an instance will not cause it to not be available any longer.",0
484,"this will result in an error, undefined variable: username , because $_post['username'] does not exist when you first load the page.",0
488,"i presume that the default will be a valid value, rather than something like ""select product"".",0
491,"you should know what is exactly raw post data: $_post can be said as and outcome after splitting the $http_raw_post_data , php splits the raw post data and formats in the way we see it in the $_post",0
497,you dont have too keep an eye on the right field order every field value becomes ' around them you have less code to write field count and order can change,0
500,it's actually returning a value of true for array_walk_recursive .,0
501,"if you look at the function's documentation , you'll see that what this method is doing is calling the function _output for each item and key in the object.",0
503,where _output is called because that is the stringified name that you gave in the array_walk_recursive function.,0
510,"once the form has been submitted, in your php code, you can do :",0
518,however the switch is not really adapted to your code as you have multiple conditions in your if .,0
521,it should work if you do two separate queries.,0
524,pdo handles this for you fantastically well by allowing you to use placeholders:,0
525,"using pdo, your final code needs to prepare the query, bind a parameter to it, execute it and then get the result (checking if there actually is a result using pdo::rowcount() ) something like this:",0
533,this approach will use all the config stuff you setup in laravel so you don't have to config pdo separately.,0
538,many times it is just a matter of reading the error provided to understand what is going wrong.,0
544,continuing blindly and hoping for the best is not really a way to produce robust code.,0
553,and the problem is clearly in get and post .,0
572,$contents[0] would be the colors line.,0
579,you can add as many attributes as you want.,0
588,all you need is to properly set site-wide error reporting.,0
589,there is also one wrong assumption regarding php.ini inaccessibility: you can always set any configuration directive using ini_set() function.,0
595,"when encountering a fatal error (and uncaught exception is one), php responds not with 200 ok http status but with 5xx status.",0
597,"or you can set up a custom error handler in php which would handle all php errors as well, an example can be seen in the article i wrote on the matter: the (im)proper use of try..catch.",0

619,"i should also add - i expect you're doing this because you're trying to use an api endpoint for something, i'd highly suggest switching to using the rest api introduced with wordpress 4.7 instead, as it allows us to offer much more consistent experience to developers. """,0
628,$count : 0) is probably what you need.,0
629,i am still not completely sure what you would like to archive but i wrote this little script that does what you named in your examples:,0
630,you may use a global variable .,0
639,"in order to sort by date, you can use the php_function array_multisort() .",0

657,"you don't need to do the select because you already have the username, and you should be checking for the $_session['username'] not if a submit button is set.",0
664,additional logic on the keys can help in this case.,0
668,it should work like a charm.,0
669,you can give a name and a value to each of your buttons.,0
673,then you wouldn't need to loop,0
674,if you echo $_get['act'] you will get vw - it does not work in the other way.,0
678,check it earlier so you can skip all that other phpmailer code that's not going to be used.,0
679,:$str1) is actually attempting to match 'hello' in the string.,0
682,this is not what you say you're trying to match.,0

689,"even if you use a dynamic ip, it should not change between two requests (it usually changes when you unplug your network cable or disconnect your wifi card).",0
694,you can't simply swap out that underlying library.,0
695,"in order to use another library, like the one provided by mysql, you have to recompile php against it.",0
700,"if you can't recompile, you're probably out of luck.",0
701,"keep in mind that microsoft offers vc9 (visual studio 2008) at no cost , so you should be able to perform the recompile, if needed.",0
720,an even more butcherful solution is to add the function definition above within wp-config.php itself .,0
726,"yes pdo can fetch two (or more) rowsets, as long as the database you are using supports it.",0

769,removing the &amp; sign alone would generate notice: undefined offset: 4 in what i think you should do is remove the &amp; and suppress any e_notice error with @ ;,0
770,lastly you can just override php isset function on your own see override_function,0
771,"first, you are mixing your procedural and your object oriented mysqli.",0
780,"next, you have to make sure all array items (the ids) are numeric.",0
781,"there are many solutions for this, for example skipping non-numeric values:",0
785,"on another note, you don't need to use preg_replace_callback for your substitutions; you can use the captured text in the replacement expression.",0

1486,"the problem is that you're always using $layout['content'] as the subject in str_replace , rather than the updated $pages[$layout['name']] .",0

1692,you don't have a session_start() call in that code block.,0

2156,"right, before we go any further.",0
2161,in addition your mysql_error() call is coming before you've actually made an sql query so it would be hard pressed to find an error in something it hasn't actually done yet.,0
2162,"i would suggest you re-work all of this with correct bound sql queries using pdo or similar, of which i am of course happy to help with.",0
2163,you should include connections.php on the top on your page if you want to make a connection to a database.,0

2193,you need to switch to mysqli or to pdo.,0
2194,there are plenty of tutorials on how to use those libraries.,0
2210,so for every query you will have a single pdostatement instance.,0
2211,you need to wrap a preg expression with a non-alphanumeric and non-backslash character (the same one on each side).,0
2212,"by using this way you can redirect a client on its correct application's subdomain, if he tried to access other clients' subdomains.",0

3054,i also believe you are calling a non existent function where you assign the $num variable it should be mysql_num_rows() not mysql_numrows .,0
3058,there is no way of doing it that does not require to execute code.,0
3063,it lists many probable reasons why this could happen.,0
3064,its mentioned on the page :,0
3066,"you can try setting mysqli.reconnect to 1 (in your php.ini), or increasing mysqli_opt_connect_timeout from options .",0
3069,you should never need to touch the $_session['fb_..._user_id'] variable.,0
3074,this will make your function to be pure.,0
3075,it will easier to debug later and it will not invoke if you don't have $_post['name'] .,0
3080,"if this is real code, you should be using password_hash and password_verify to handle login.",0
3081,"currently, you are storing passwords in plaintext, free for any hacker to look at.",0
3094,"you only have one key=>value pair in your array: key 0 with a value of 1,2,3 .",0
3117,"be careful to make sure that character case is correct for script/page names, especially on a *nix system, getstates.php‌ and getstates.php would not be the same.",0
3118,( straight shootin' from ralph! ),0
3132,or you can just use the $_request (although it is not very good to use it),0
3133,as you are using str_replace with single quotes i.e.,0
3134,(' ') then when you include a single quote within them it thinks you are closing the function.,0
3138,you need to loop through $_post['products'] to find the new checked ones and you need to loop through $already_selected to find the unchecked ones.,0
3152,a simple check i did locally to debug this—since i don’t have http_x_rhn_provisioning_mac_4 in my setup—was just to get the http_host like this:,0
3163,so though $_session seems brut force to you -- it is a logical option.,0
3166,shamelessly poached from manual page here .,0
3167,use a variable like $theguest or the session variable directly.,0
3168,"use bindparam , you are in pdo anyway, leverage it :>",0
3173,"you are unsetting the session variable because if you will not do that then it will work only for the first time, because after that your session will set permanentlytherefore you have to unset them",0
3178,your code is using the object approach so i think in your db file change the $conn line to:,0
3184,this also presumes all fields were integers as your original queries did.,0
3187,you probably need to wrap each set of &lt;input/&gt; s in separate &lt;form/&gt; tags.,0
3190,"it isn't that different but mysqli seems to have a wrapper over mysql and uses the ""->"" to instantiate new classes for a connection.",0
3195,this would be stored in a config file of some sort or in the class you have which creates a database connection.,0
3198,"you could then store the fact that your user is authenticated in a $_session variable, and have your application code check that variable to see if a user should be allowed to remain on the ""dashboard"" or be redirected back to login page.",0
3209,"increase the amount of allowed memory ini_set(""memory_limit"", ""512m""); or in the php.ini file itself break your process into multiple chunks of, say, 5000 a piece.",0
3222,you'll need to implode that before you do anything else:,0
3223,"right now you're trying to nl2br on an array, which won't work.",0
3235,another way to look at it would be to examine the algorithmic complexity of each cast.,0
3245,the cast operator handler first forces a copy of the input variable.,0
3258,"the cast version, on the other hand, will perform 5 memory allocations, 5 memory copies, followed by 2 type checks, followed by 5 type checks and 5 equality checks ( memcmp() or the like).",0
3266,thus __isset() returns the expected result when a null value is set.,0
3272,"even if e-mail addresses can't have spaces, etc.",0
3277,"you do not need libxml_no_cdata ; it only makes a difference when you're turning the object back into xml anyway (it also makes a difference to the result of print_r , but you shouldn't rely on that anyway for ""magic"" objects like simplexmlelement) $newsoutput = json_decode(json_encode($newsoutput), true); basically says ""throw away all the useful bits of the simplexml api, and attempt to give me an array with no guarantee of its format"" adding string manipulation on top of that is just adding hacks to hacks.",0
3280,"so if you're changing the limit by submitting a form, pass along the page number as a hidden form field:",0
3282,i don't recommend storing things like this in the session.,0
3284,it's best to pass everything in the request (i.e.,0
3310,array_merge creates a new merged array.,0
3321,"secondly, you have a lot of syntax issues which you could easily find yourself by enabling error reporting...",0
3323,"note: when using the isset() you don't need to match it to true or false, you can simple do:",0
3326,"you can pull apart $_server['request_uri'] with regular expressions or explode, the function parse_url() is very handy here...",0
3328,apache's mod_rewrite automatically decodes urlencoded strings when it does regex matching.,0
3329,"but it only does this once, so you should be if you urlencode your string twice.",0
3330,this will re-escape all of those `%' characters.,0
3341,"to get the first line of the address, try this:",0
3349,"if it is a new post/page, i guess the id does not exists yet, because the post has not been published/added to db.",0
3353,"you can use functions/classes/methods or even some included files, though, to not end up with one big chunk of un-readable / un-maintenable code...",0
3356,the most common way of doing this would be to do all your validation checks in purchase.php .,0
3372,example from addtocartform.tpl.php which is the little form onsisting of the 'add to cart' button and quantity controls if switched on:,0
3382,"nb:i can see you checking a $_post[""submit""] in your form, if it is the same submit you are using in the html code, you will get the error even after changing it to my code.",0

3385,the problem is that the str_replace is executed after the echo .,0
3390,add the follow lines just inside the if statement and you should be ok,0
3392,"//echo ""somestring""; -> echo ""somestring""; several re-starts of httpd, no changes to httpd.conf or php.ini",0
3398,then you can sanitize both the name and the value field.,0
3416,that's why you always get redirected to the invalid login url.,0
3420,that would assign 0 to $num and execute the code in the body of that if statement.,0
3426,"$_server['document_root'] is for server-side pathing so to speak, as you already noted.",0
3436,"it must be added at the top of the php page and once the work is done, destroy the session:",0
3453,if you want use this array further make foreach and execute,0
3454,in addition to what everyone else said this should fix your errors.,0
3456,"also, i don't use mysqli i use pdo so you will have to forgive me if the syntax is slightly wrong.",0
3476,"in your example the value of $_post['student_no'] will be string '$student_no' , not the value of the $student_no variable.",0
3480,"for the purpose of the function, why not just use array_unique($array) ?",0
3484,"since all keys are unique in an array, you will remove all duplicates.",0
3485,you are trying to execute an update query based on an insert's format.,0
3507,"i respectfully suggest the way my preceding php code does which answers the questions, ""was a form submitted?",0
3508,"and, if so does it contain any data?""",0
3510,that means you need to validate the posted data before using it.,0
3511,the mysql extension has been deprecated as of php5.5; see discussion at the mysql extension is deprecated and will be removed in the future: use mysqli or pdo instead .,0
3521,first the parameter order is wrong in the array_map call.,0
3522,"second, you need to pass the item value as a reference in order to change it:",0
3524,you don't actually need to specify it in your just wanting to do an = comparison on a laravel -&gt;where() .,0
3528,i think delimiter is no longer required with php pdo.,0
3532,"if the dead script was in the middle of a transaction, the next script that gets that connection also gets the transaction state.",0
3536,"unless you have identified creating database connections as the one thing that is a bottleneck in your script (this means you've done code profiling using xdebug and/or xhprof ), you should not consider persistent connections as a solution to anything.",0
3550,"for ease of use, the safe behavior has been made the default at the expense of maximum performance.",0
3554,many people simply don't realize you are able to increase *max_connections* variable and obtain over 100 concurrent connections with mysql others were beaten by older linux problems of the inability to convey more than 1024 connections with mysql.,0
3557,the actual reason is – you can get a lot more issues with it.,0
3565,it reuses connections when a) they are available and the host/user/password/database match.,0
3568,the key thing to understand about persistent connections is that you should not use them in most web applications.,0
3572,pdo does not exhibit such behaviour,0
3573,"in general you could use this as a rough ""ruleset""::",0
3574,"there are only few applications/users accessing the database, i.e.you will not result in 200 open (but probably idle) connections,because there are 200 different users shared on the same host.",0
3578,"using persistent connections is considerable faster, especially if you are accessing the database over a network.",0
3583,"after that, new connections are refused (you can tweak this setting).",0
3585,the problem is in quoter function that called for each string parameter dblib_handle_quoter in ext\pdo_dblib\dblib_driver.c .,0
3598,"for example if you wanted to also strip out any existing plain white space between the list items, you could use this:",0
3600,you need to add quotes in the values and based on the error you need to escape those variables first as well since name has a quote in it.,0
3603,"change $_post['fruit'] to $_post['email'] , and you don't need the loop, because the post data is already an array.",0
3605,"first, you need to tell pdo to throw exceptions on connect errors.",0
3614,that leaves it as 'undefined' without it issuing variable doesn't exist warnings.,0
3615,"there's also, of course, php's filter extension.",0
3622,this passes a json array of objects to php with the ajax post method.,0
3642,"at every iteration, $ma receives a new array() with just one element containing $list['id'] value.",0
3644,"when it reaches $na = implode(',', $ma); , there is actually not enough elements to form an imploded list with separation, since there's no elements to separate (just the last one set for $ma ).",0
3650,this returns the object of pdo once the database class is instantiated if the getinstance is invoked for first time otherwise it just returns the created pdo instance.,0
3663,in order to print the result you have to use:,0
3668,as such the following edit should fix your problem.,0
3671,"you could use css to style it so it looks like a link, or anything not-button like.",0
3674,i think you need to be specifying the absolute save path rather than the relative path it looks like you have now.,0
3699,it's not pretty; but you can make use of the php array functions to perform this action:,0
3703,the usual idiom in php for looping over an array is the foreach operator.,0
3704,"array_walk and array_map can be used, but they didn't become common idioms because until relatively recent versions of php creating anonymous functions was inconvenient.",0
3712,thats why you are getting variable with the name of array index (here $_get ).,0
3728,for this snippet of code try the following:,0
3729,furthermore you need to use only one html form that includes all your inputs.,0
3748,it will ensure your values are entered correctly and will do very well at protecting you from sql-injection.,0
3756,in this fairly simple example there's a great deal of mental effort that needs to be put into parsing the statement:,0
3763,i suspect that's not what you want.,0
3767,"also, do not mix up pdo and mysqli.",0
3771,click on the () clear sign to clear all entries if needed.,0
3772,then when the ajax call proceeds check out the response.,0
3777,"try this by concatenating the value in the string via php,",0
3792,"then you can get the values from php: $_post['os'] will return android , ios or may be empty if no value is selected.",0
3799,"(and to make matters worse, this is not documented well at all in the php documentation.)",0
3803,you need to make sure that you are escaping any data properly to prevent that.,0
3807,"instead, check the contents of the https server variable:",0
3812,you should strip the input at least.,0
3813,or use switch..case blocks for all defined possible input variables.,0
3817,"that isnt particular elegant though and likely error prone, especially when you dont only have scalars or multidimensional arrays.",0
3825,"for example, if you have ""script_a.php"" that call a function ""thisfile()"", where ""thisfile()"" is in another ""script_b.php"" through include_once, then the result will be different.",0
3830,"try logging all your php variables to console: print print_r($this-&gt;rec-&gt;variable_name, true); and then check to make sure that all your variables are strings, and that none are null.",0
3832,"font type, font size, etc) is consistent in each template variable.",0
3845,your index.php doesn't contain session_destroy() - you need to use home.php?logout .,0
3857,1) how do you assign a value to your $_get['id'] because with what you have on your url $_get['id'] will always return null since it has no values from anywhere.,0
3864,that array is then used to order the values in $arr .,0
3874,"however, using strip_tags() before the parser won't do harm, and it could help guard against attempts to use the parser against you by letting it eat up a lot of resources - though if the parser can cause issues (i'd expect it to have safeguards against that), that tends to happen through nesting depth, not through tag.",0
3875,"i see no reason to recommend it in your case; but i see no reason to dissuade you from using it, either.",0
3878,the database stores the data .,0
3879,"the point of ""escaping"" the data (or, better yet, use placeholders/parameterized queries ) is making sure the data makes it into the database correctly and safely.",0
3882,"it is quite sad, but the entire point of needing to ""escape"" still exists because of the incorrect concatenation of data into sql strings.",0
3888,but only as long as you always follow the exact same procedure.,0
3890,"and more actually, you should use a scheme that involves a better salt (per-user).",0
3897,note that such malware is often picked up by google: they'll add a warning to such a hacked website's index: ' this site may harm your computer. ',0
3898,"getting this notion removed requires a ' request a malware-review ' with google webmaster-tools (i don't know if google will automatically rescan your page in x amount of time if you don't report your page as fixed, neither do i know if you can report your page as fixed without google-webmaster tools, so be warned if you don't want to give your cellphone-number to google!!!",0
3906,so i updated my decoder to include a base/radix setting (and all the depending links in this answer) and as one can see the payload is still the same (apart from the domain it points to).,0
3910,naturally the variants that specialize in distributing malware now try to hide themselves from the search-engines.,0
3911,you can try use function addslashes for prepare data before insert.,0
3923,"if the session variable is set, then you can show content which should only be shown to logged in users.",0
3930,i would do this by using ajax and jquery.,0
3932,"i have put numbered anchors in your code, and the notes are at the end.",0
3935,"this will: (1) clean up your code, (2) be able to process all database queries at the same time.",0

3989,"i am not sure what information you are getting from the database, but you should have a unique id in the database for each post which you grab in the array as well.",0
3991,"you code must be improved, your logic isn't good.",0
3992,"first of all, you don't need to use a session var, one alternative to do this is passing the post id using a get argument, something like this:",0
4023,"for example, you could store the username in the session during the login process:",0
4027,use preg_match() that find target part of string using regex.,0

4043,"if you check out var_dump($client-&gt;__getfunctions()) , you can see, that the parameters have to be passed like with a normal function call.",0
4045,that's the problem with your code.,0

5858,"you might want to define it in your main function and just pass it to your fulltohalf() function, or not bother with a function at all.",0
5886,and bind the inputs you want like you did before.,0
5889,another easy way for an empty string to be part of the explode output would be an input string with a line break at the end:,0
5899,this value ought to have been calculated client side when running the post query.,0
5902,"also, you might want to investigate why does php, while decoding the post and therefore being able to verify its length, nonetheless seems to accept a wrong length (maybe the information needed to detect the error is somewhere among the $_server variables?",0
5903,"if it does match though, and still data isn't arriving (i.e., the content-length is smaller, and correctly describes the cut-off post), then it is proof that the post was inspected after the cut-off, and therefore either the error is in the browser (or, unlikely, in jquery) or there is something between the browser and the server (a proxy?)",0
5909,"if the error is at the network level , i.e., the post is prepared and supplied with a correct content-length, but the interruption makes it so that the whole data is cut off as this comment by horen seems to indicate:",0

5956,(only the connection (mysql in this case) who has locked can write.),0
5960,"obviously + and - are there, and i guess / as well, and anything with a number?",0

5979,you can set a variable to refer to null.,0
5986,my sympathies if you have no control over that :(,0
5988,and they are not the same.,0
5989,select id from users where id='{$_session['id']}'; does not return the same value as select id from users where id='{session_id()}'; you need either to insert $_session['id'] or select record with id == session_id() .,0

6042,"as suggested, some code and more details would be helpful.",0
6044,a post submit only submits the form fields contained with that particular block.,0
6046,you then inject this in the form ; something like this would probably do :,0
6050,"for instance, your php code is using get , but your code here is not including the gid in the action attribute.",0

6088,1) run the for loop for $i&lt;count($a) not $i&lt;=count($a) because you start $i with zero so you need to run the for loop for one counter less than count($a),0
6089,"2) it will if(!in_array($a[$i], $b)) instead of if(!in_array($b,$a[$i])) because you need to find element of $a array to be already pushed in new array $b or not",0
6102,for bigger arrays it might be worthwhile to run a benchmark to determine whether an array conversion step would still be worth it.,0
6116,use var_dump to show the contents of $details .,0
6118,you are posting the form to $_server['php_self'] .,0
6121,"to filter on unique stdclass, using only a few of the attributes you could try something like:",0

6139,you have missed the session_start() at the top of your dologin.php .,0
6143,you will want to show login form if there is no $_session['user'],0
6147,"check and make sure the path (/tmp) is writable by the user running the web server, as this may be a permissions problem.",0

6185,make sure you are sending your form and using the post method.,0
6186,it looks like that your post request is not sending a variable id .,0
6200,the absolute minimum you need to do here is escape that variable:,0
6206,that is your query looks like this:,0
6229,i'd try to avoid using references in foreach loops because you need to unset the referenced variable.,0
6231,"group is a reserved word in mysql, so you have to escape it to use it in a query, in a pdo query just as you would in a normal query.",0
6232,this will get you the keys.,0
6237,except no keys in the array are ip addresses.,0
6243,you should implode the placeholders and let pdo do the work,0
6247,you need to research the lifecycle of a php request .,0
6250,this other request has no post variables so $_post['html'] is an empty string.,0
6251,now why the second time does pdf.php not return the value it returned the first you ask?,0
6257,you should either perform the ajax request and then take the returned data and inject it into the current page (you can use the first parameter passed to the success function) or forego ajax altogether and just redirect to pdf.php .,0
6265,edit: of course you need to specify all variables you want to unset.,0
6266,the sql should be executed to return a result $insert,0
6267,"(and, as mentioned it's much safer to use prepared statements.)",0
6275,you are trying to send data from task.php -&gt; showcats.php !,0
6276,your code does that very well by using this:,0
6278,so it's normal to find that var_dump($_post) return null.,0
6280,"instead of using cookies, you could use sessions to get a better contact with the user machine.",0
6285,"secondly, please move on to pdo or mysqli to avoid getting your website hosed by the first annoyed user that comes along.",0
6288,"im not sure is this what you are trying to do, but check my example:",0
6290,for some reason the php bits such as '.$specific_field_title.',0
6310,or else you can use the same in procedural method with mysqli_* functions.,0
6312,"you don't need to use any class or external library, to remove html tags from user input.",0
6315,"if this is your code , its catastroph for sql injections .",0
6318,"first of all, you really should use mysqli.",0
6321,"if you are not using mysqli after all, know that the code that you wrote is not working because of 2 issues:",0
6322,"you spelled $name = $_post[""usersname""]; as usersname instead of username on the line $result = mysql_query(""select * from members where username = $name""); you need to escape the string like this: username = "" .",0
6325,"you must not store passwords in plain text, as it is an enormous security risk.",0
6329,you can find more information in the comments on that page.,0
6330,"in your html for the select options, try something like this:",0
6331,it's much more elegant if you define your option values in an array:,0
6344,look for the options available to whatever database connection method you are user.,0
6348,the only way to tell if a client has accepted a cookie is if the cookie gets sent back to the server by the client on its next request.,0
6357,there are a couple of issues.,0
6361,so your code should have something like this:,0
6362,$con only needs to be set once and can be used in other query calls in your code.,0
6364,anyone who has access to your computer or to your network if you're not using ssl can steal your cookies and log in to your account.,0
6370,but if you use || instead of | the if condition skips the second argument if the first already failed.,0
6371,you use sha1 for hashing your passwords.,0
6372,but this algorithm is a bad practice.,0
6374,"you never store the user info in a session to retain the login on next requests, the way you're implementing it is called a remember me function and is considered hard to implement safely.",0
6381,when the user logged in once with that cookie you should refresh the cookie with a new hash.,0
6389,mysql_real_escape_string is aware of a few things that addslashes is not.,0
6404,it is not a final solution.,0
6405,take it as a modest $_post explanation.,0
6408,you can start with outputting the number of items for example.,0
6413,if you don't find them all you go on to try and write the information to the database.,0
6417,"you're printing error information from the connection object, but not looking at error information from the statement object.",0
6419,"you also catch pdoexception, but we can't see any code where those exceptions are enabled, see the manual entry for pdo::setattribute() in case you're not aware that you need to enable these.",0
6423,"now, in your php code page you first need to call the class file above:",0
6428,"so this will now have a name value array of results from the $result array, each initial row will correspond to each initial row of the $parameters query.",0
6431,by using this you can get the value of selected option from the dropdown .,0
6433,you don't want to try to match the password during the query as matching the hash would not work.,0
6434,in order to verify the password you will want to do something like this:,0
6437,examples are easy to find if you examine other questions with the sql-injection tag.,0
6444,you are getting this error because php is trying to convert an array to string.,0
6446,you can use the flag sort_regular to compare the elements as they are.,0
6448,"generally, this kind of iterator is 'less-than-ideal' code for several reasons.",0
6452,"that means $name is an array, which is obviously an illegal string offset.",0
6461,"if you say you wanted to display only the info about users logged in, you are getting all users without conditions",0
6466,most likely any value will do.,0
6479,"if i'm reading your question correctly, your main problem is that you are printing the arrays correctly to the screen but failing to store them in a way that you can send to the sql server in a query.",0
6482,this line suggests that $_post['name'] is an array.,0
6483,if that's the case you will have problems with this line:,0

6600,the easiest way to do this as all your columns are strings would be,0
6601,you should then be able to echo out the actual query that's being run to see what the problem is.,0

7112,the reason why the result aren't displaying is because you fetched all the row already so you cannot use fetch() again.,0
7113,use the array returned by fetchall() instead and use a foreach instead,0
7130,one way to do this is specify the unix_socket instead of host in the dsn:,0
7132,$user = $result-&gt;fetch(); probably returns an array.,0

8085,then concatenate it in the main string.,0
8087,"however, my guess is that your expectations may be different from what this code actually does.",0
8093,so you'll need to clarify exactly what you want the code to do and provide some reproducible example of what didn't work ( and that includes the data used or arguments provided to the function ).,0
8094,"so since you're looking for the existence of the needle in any part of the array and don't actually care about the key, you may want to make your intent more obvious in the logic.",0

8103,i would suggest using array access notation in your form inputs such that you have a better way to know where to get your key data from.,0
8107,you should really look into mysqli or pdo.,0

8413,maintain an array of extensions that you'd like to disallow and then use in_array() to check if the extension of the filename is in that array:,0
8414,you'd probably be better looping through the values you enter from your $_post and match them up to your array values.,0

8502,i hope it works for you.if you want to know also what tags each user have on the same query just adjust the contain or recursive value.,0
8507,perhaps you have got an if-clause which will not be executed or something like this ( if(false) $_session['user_id'] = $user_id; would be wrong).,0
8537,and then you can display the data in your table.,0
8539,you should specify some session parameters before you want to print them,0

8662,"the basics seem right, although you will need to move the &lt;table&gt; tag out of the while loop, now you are creating a table for every entry and my guess is that that´s not what you want.",0
8666,"you didn't post your code inside controller.php but considering that your first approach was accessing that code via url parameters, i'll assume that you are executing variables in that code as get variables (example: $_get['patient_id'] ).",0

8719,"so it needs an actual array to work on it; not the resturned value of other functions, which doesn't really exists as a variable.",0
8723,a first approach to fix the error might be:,0
8732,it can be confusing to your future self and other maintainers as to where the data is coming from.,0
8733,"it can cause collisions, and create hard-to-find bugs in which you are getting the wrong data (because $_request covers $_get , $_post , and $_cookie ).",0

8740,"then, you have to wrap by single quotes your field values:",0
8742,to avoid sql injection (assuming your prodid values are integers).,0
8744,you need to actually read that row.,0
8748,so your limit clause is entirely unnecessary in the example you've given.,0
8750,"easiest way to solve this, is to copy the array and foreach over the first array, delete the key in the second array... than use the second array further on in your code.",0

8774,what you're trying to do seems more like allowing some html tags while removing the others.,0
8780,note that you should not use extract($_post); .,0
8787,"you'll have to specify the index, as $_post['name'] etc.",0
8795,"assuming the index of array1 corresponds to the index of array2, you just need to find the indexes of $array2 whose values are 0. once you've done that, just unset the elements with the given index from both arrays.",0

8806,printf specifically outputs a formatted string and returns the length of the string.,0
8824,simply use array_map like as its an array of objects you can simply achieve it like as,0
8833,the way the keys are being created above is not great and in retrospect it is the wrong way to do it.,0
8834,"to demonstrate the right way to do it, let's imagine we have the following array, nice and simple:",0

8876,you could store it in a $_session variable but it's unreliable and users could easily reset the session cookie.,0
8877,i'd do something like this instead:,0

8896,"if you can't use that either, use $sanitized_string = mysql_real_escape_string($string); to sanitize the url and make sure you only use $sanitized_string with the database.",0
8900,this is what i would do:,0
8904,you should be able to see it in chrome dev tools though.,0
8908,the value of $_cookie is set by reading cookies received from the browser.,0
8913,"make sure magic quotes are off or, if you can't disable them, cleanse your strings from them.",0
8916,and the great escapism (or: what you need to know to work with text within text) .,0

8923,"if you want to know what was returned from your ajax post, you need your success function to accept a parameter (like data ) that jquery will fill with the response to your post.then in the function body, you can write it to the dom or your error console.",0

8934,taken from a comment of the php documentation for strip_tags(),0
8937,"use at least mysql_real_escape_string() on user input, or better bind your variables to your queries.",0
8950,above answer ashis biswas is fine and you also need to take care that you should check your login session in your controller as in codeigniter you are accessing your controller function instead of view.,0

9106,what you have to do is parse $_server['request_uri'] and then do what you need to it.,0
9111,"then the form will redirect to the same script where it's generated (so not sure if the second set of code you have is on the same file or different) also you don't need to write the bracket once the values are passed, you just need to use the name of the variable (it's already an array).",0
9112,"as i mentioned this variable is already an array of every checkbox you selected, so you will need to 1) go through the list individually or 2) construct your query so you can retrieve them all in one go.",0

9188,"note that in the original, the === comparison operator is being used, but in yours you are using == .",0

9194,you can add a hidden field with the index to determine which session index it is.,0
9203,"imho, the best way to handle this properly is to create your own thin database layer and encapsulate calls to mysql_query in your own functions.",0

9209,though you would likely wrap it in a try/catch and set exceptions to be thrown in your pdo instance to make sure it's even legit.,0

9225,"to check this, you may like to do a print_r($_post) just before where the if() starts and see how it looks like.",0

9785,"as you can see from the output of var_dump , your required value is being stored as a member count(distinct writing.id) of the object.",0
9787,"first, you are trying to use sqlite_num_rows on a pdo handle.",0
9791,will return a result set that looks something like this:,0
9798,the side effect of this approach is that you are protected from sql injection .,0
9799,next take a look here: how to change the session timeout in php?,0
9803,"it shouldn't fail on htmlspecialchars() output, ever.",0
9817,also note that your code is most likely vulnerable to sql injection.,0
9831,"your method is get , which won't give you what you're after if you're looking for the values in the post collection, which $_post does.",0
9833,"for a good discussion of get vs post, take a look here: when do you use post and when do you use get?",0
9834,"notice how you are only applying :email in your query paramaters, but your query is expecting both :email and :picture.",0
9837,because your array keys were not wrapped in quotes they were assumed (by the php parser) to be constants.,0
9838,"since they are not constants, defined within your application, they are not valid array keys.",0
9843,"as fas as i can see, you can leave these be:",0
9850,this means that the 2 basic things that your session variables should have are userid and usertype which you should also store in your database,0
9853,"in order for your application to know what usera can view or edit in your application, you basically run a comparison in your script against the usertype that usera has.",0
9861,i would suggest you use an named array in your multiple &lt;select&gt; .,0
9869,"but if the variations in behavior are of limited scope, consider it over dynamic code execution like what you're trying to do.",0
9870,"since you're using php, you could use sessions to see if they have permission to be at level 2 or above.",0
9876,upload_err_partial value: 3; the uploaded file was only partiallyuploaded.,0
9878,uploaded files will by default be stored in the server’s default temporary directory.,0
9893,strip_tags() removes html from the value of a variable.,0
9897,i then merge it with the $_get array using array_merge .,0
9902,'&amp;yourstuff=whateves'; i guess you could wrap that in a function if you really wanted to.,0
9904,if you want only the get requests you can do:,0
9906,just past the print_r output in it.,0
9912,first of all you call this right at the top of your php file:,0
9913,"to start the session, then you can set $_session variables.",0
9921,"should the query restrict where field = ""new order by name desc"" or should it restrict where field = ""new"" and then order the results by the ""name"" field in descending order?",0
9925,"this will work for the first loop, but won't execute the second because you've already reached the end.",0
9927,immediately before the second loop to set the pointer to the beginning again.,0
9942,you can set the search input value with the $_post array (or $_get if you used get method).,0
9944,"by the way, if you want to be able to not keep the value :",0
9945,you could also use a checkbox or something ... :),0
9950,i simply prepended an @ to the session_start() to suppress the warnings in the log.,0
9954,not sure what you're trying to do with !$_get['action'] == 'reply',0
9973,"as much as i understand, you are trying to implement something like pagination?",0
9977,"if you won't have a query string, you can explode on /.",0
9988,note: you can also optionally make sure certain tags do not get stripped by passing those tags as a second parameter,0
9989,then you can retrive it with $_get['search'] instead of $_post['search'] .,0
10016,"edit: also, maybe it is another type of apostrophe you have entered in the form: ’ .",0
10032,"you can have an array of possible url's and you can check the value of $_get['url'] against these values, then redirect the user accodingly.",0
10040,if you want the html to be rendered as html then don't use htmlentities() .,0
10044,using the following should work in your script:,0
10046,"this is a very bad way of doing it, but this is a cleaned up version of your deprecated code so that it should work.",0
10047,name1 in your original code needed to be $name1 .,0
10062,"you could also use prepared statements or parameterized query builder (see sql syntax for prepared statements , pdo – prepared statements und stored procedures , mysqli::prepare , et al.",0
10066,"well, anyway, something along those lines.",0
10075,"strpos will properly return 0 for the hit, but 0 evaluates to false in a standard equality test.",0
10084,you can just unset that key explicitly like in your example it would look as if you were trying to do:,0
10085,"first, what loushou mentioned was correct, however, there is a little bit more to it.",0
10088,"normally the load balancer forwards the real client ip in the $_server array under a new key, in most cases $_server['http_x_forwarded_for']",0
10095,"you don't need to alter the data you insert into the database, you only have to alter the string you send to the database server as query (unless you do the wise choice and use prepared statements instead of escaping the query string).",0
10098,"in php, change the minus sign to equal sign when setting the value from the $_post variable.",0
10102,so the first step in your case is:,0
10105,"unless you take special steps to handle the html, the browser's going to see html and render it as such.",0
10110,aren't you trying to see if the key exists at all?,0
10112,"you can cast the get parameter to int, which will just use the numeric part and strip off anything else.",0
10121,based on the keys of the associative array $row.,0
10126,use unserialize($serializedoptions) to convert it back into an array.,0
10144,"so if somebody makes a request with http, he will get the cookie unencrypted.",0
10150,the best way would be to extend the pdo class.,0
10154,"you say that str_replace is not an option but if you pair it with replace , you can effectively ignore dashes in your comparison by removing them from both your needle and haystack",0
10163,you can use the querystring library to parse a object into a name-value pair query string that you could than transmit with content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded so that the data will be parsed into the globals,0
10165,"as mentioned in the comments, you're trying to access properties of $check_box_values as if it were an array, when in fact, it's a string.",0
10168,"you can use explode to split the input on each ; , loop over the results and then split over each .",0
10173,"if you have an older php version, it may need to be done in two statements:",0
10182,"$_post and $_get are global variables, so you can get away with just checking them with isset() .",0
10185,and then on the non wp page you have something like,0
10186,if you are redirecting them to another domain it's best that you put the username in the get parameters.,0
10188,while vladimir gets some credit - since he pointed me to setcookie() - a major problem is the need to place setcookie before the html line in a file; not so easy in wp.,0
10191,don't be like the school who fell for bobby tables .,0
10197,change the setcookie() like to somethig like this:,0
10219,"this also explains why nothing happens, because the function is not being called on onload, but as soon as the browser executes the script.",0
10224,"full credit to @josh davis and @hakre, who discuss this at this answer .",0
10225,and you should get the contents of the &lt;estado&gt; tag.,0
10233,"there is a simple workaround to what you are doing, let's say you have 10 checkboxes.",0
10236,then the code checks which one has a value in $_post and which one does not.,0
10239,you can check what is the returned value of $products by using print_r or var_dump to confirm that it is an object and not a string.,0
10245,"i think you approach to using pdo prepared statements is largely correct, however i would point out that you may consider using different variable names for the statment object if you need to work with them both simultaneously.",0
10247,"while speaking of getting results from a prepared query, there is indeed a problem caused by the result buffering.",0
10249,to get errors you have to ask php for them .,0
10253,fetch your query results one by one.,0
10254,your mysqli syntax even for a single query is incomplete.,0
10257,it does not look like you need to be using regular expressions.,0
10264,at least not without some additional web server configuration.,0
10265,"typically to achieve ""clean url's"" like this in php, there is a url rewrite that is performed in the webserver ( mod_rewrite for example on apache).",0
10278,"if for some reason those numeric ids in your database change, you'll run into trouble maintaining your code.",0
10281,"so you create a function that returns true or false, and test each element of the array against it.",0
10292,"if you are the owner of salesgenie.com then i think you have a problem with the server, since sometimes the responses i got was either a timeout (code 0), code 200 (with result) or code 320. so the problem might be a problem within the server itself.",0
10294,also try using http instead of https since https requires some more processing to use.,0
10301,"in your case, yes you are right you have to prevent it from being injected, but you are altering the original input by adding slashes into the original input, which is not very favoured.",0
10312,so for those who have a problem with $_server['php_auth_user'] they first need to check their serverapi from phpinfo(); if it is cgi there is no way to use $_server['php_auth_user'] you need to recompile php.,0
10313,are you sure that your variable $username in your query is what you expect it to be?,0
10318,you have form with method=post and in php you are using $_get .,0
10321,"second, $query is not valid sql.",0
10327,you also need to remove these as there is no point to using them:,0
10333,"since each $subarray represents a different user, you need to store the parsed key/value pair in a subarray too.",0
10342,my 2nd recommendation is that you should use the dev branch code (which is actually stable - but not yet declared as such): https://github.com/eyecatchup/seostats/tree/dev,0
10347,i would just do a manual loop and output to a new variable.you cant use array_map or array_walk to change the structure of an array.,0
10354,you're probably confused with the command of the official command-line client:,0
10361,for the first and how can i prevent sql injection in php?,0
10362,for the second just fetch your data and use it as a flag for the last,0
10364,"if your form and php/mysql are inside the same file, you will need to use isset() or !empty() for your variables.",0
10372,and on each such computer mysql server remote access should be enabled for your computer's ip address and mysql user you are using in 'new mysqli_connect()'.,0
10399,please update your code to use pdo.,0
10409,this possibility has already been covered by jszobody’s answer .,0
10410,there are a few solutions here.,0
10414,the $_session array stores everything you throw at it.,0
10430,"if you look at the documentation for strip_tags , it shows that the second parameter is ""allowed tags"", so an example of how to allow br, p and strong is like so:",0
10435,note : you should not rely on $_server['http_referer'] for the back value.,0
10441,"if a variable exists and contains an empty string, isset() will still return true, which probably isn't what you want.",0
10444,you could do something like this:,0
10455,update: now that your code is posted; you need to modify the code so that it will insert the file name in the database.,0
10458,you could make sure that they are numbered starting with text0 .,0
10476,so this is how you would have to write it.,0
10492,you have a problem with reading the contents of the file and transfer back.,0
10497,"if removing specific values from get is what you want, use is my little beast (this code allows you to do something before removing):",0
10503,"if you want to use a button instead of input type submit replace $_post[""submit""] with your button name $_post[""wizard-submit""] .",0
10511,"you can also achieve it by using preg_match in cases when your image name contain other characters like extra - or numbers, here is example:",0
10512,"the key in the $_post superglobal will not be the "" type "" attribute of the input of the form, but it's "" name "" attribute -- or something based on its name, depending on the input's type (for an image input, there should be image_x and image_y , if i remember correctly) .",0
10515,this has the added bonus of still working just fine if the user hits the back button and resubmits an earlier part of the form (it will overwrite the previously saved values),0
10516,you have a syntax error in your query which causes you to not have a valid mysqli statement object.,0
10519,"echoing php into a script is considered bad practice...but if you really can't avoid it, and think of a better way to do it...then here you go....",0
10520,it was because you have to open the php tags and echo those str_replaces...,0
10521,"either you need to check every time they load a page, or possibly look at an ajax call at set intervals to check their status from the db.",0
10530,"also, in your server-side, you'll better decode the input $_post['data'] with json_decode() (see documentaion )",0
10539,"to add values in an array, you use the array_push method.",0
10540,you have to use delimiters when you are using the perl compatible regular expressions (pcre) functions in php (to which preg_match() belongs).,0
10541,"the reason for using delimiters is that you can add pattern modifiers after the last delimiter, e.g.",0
10543,"then it encounters [ and treats it as pattern modifier , but it is not a valid one.",0
10565,"if you don't know if it sounds right, you'll have a hard time implementing it.",0
10566,"it's inside the variable $_server['http_referer'] , but you don't need a mysql_real_escape string around that just to check if the user comes from a particular site.",0
10575,you so don't want to have this code on your server.,0
10577,"after that, you cannot expect it to contain the original template upon a next iteration.",0
10578,you'll have to use a temporary variable for this:,0
10584,$row[0] should be an int type in order to get proper results.,0
10588,"now we can implode the array on "", "" and we'll have a proper list of column names the user wants to see.",0
10597,"in this case it is mysqli_real_escape_string .as pdf files contain binary data and no text, you shouldn't add and remove slashes on saving and after reading (text processing).",0
10599,it allows a data length of up to ~16 mb.,0
10603,the relevant configuration option is max_allowed_packet .,0
10605,see this thread for ideas on how to resolve this problem.,0
10608,"use fetch as you may guess it fetches the next row from a result setthe fetch_style parameter determines how pdo returns the row, in your case fetch_assoc would be a good one since it returns an array indexed by column name as returned in your result set.",0
10616,when you want to access the property teamname you therefore need to access the item and not the query as a whole.,0
10620,you just need to fetch all rows at once:,0
10623,"you don't need to do -&gt;name on it, you can just use it as is.",0
10640,you also should drop the quotes.,0
10645,"so, you should simple nest your loops, like so.",0
10663,that's why i 'm suggesting to not use it.,0
10666,then you can use ' htmlentities ',0
10669,more information about try &amp; catch and how to work with exceptions can be found in the php documentation .,0
10677,"as you can see, i've inserted the strpos within the loop itself and it works like a peach.",0
10678,maybe not the most elegant solution.,0
10682,that would look something like this instead:,0
10684,but the server-side code isn't looking at your screen or interacting with your web browser.,0
10710,"$_post['q'] is an array, so your $query8 will fail as you use:",0
10714,"if you use dynamic database, table or fieldnames mysql_real_escape_string will not work nor will any other escape function.",0
10719,the other parts should be fairly easy by using if statements to check if the relevant data exists or not.,0
10732,"you can use javascript, which works client-side, to do this.",0
10799,"maybe not, i have not tested your code but i'm thinking if $_get['uid'] has a value of .+1234.56 or some other similar weird cases of the likes you may get unexpected results.",0
10820,not really if it is some text file or is inaccessible by any browser outside.,0
10822,"the error: "" mysqli_query() expects parameter 1 to be mysqli, null given "" means either you are not connected to your mysql database or there is an error in your $query = mysqli_connect() script.",0
10831,"edit - if you really want to use mysql_* calls then try this, which will at least let you know what the errors are:-",0
10835,when you process the form you loop through the checkboxes you get the index of each checkbox array item and use that as the index to access the item_name field.,0
10844,"pdo supports a convenient shortcut by passing an array to $stmt-&gt;execute() , where each key's value is bound to the placeholder as the key.",0
10845,"(caveat: it casts each value to a string, so you have to bind one at a time if your statement has a variable limit .",0
10856,"the key is in being able to easily transform the string in what you need it to be when you are showing it.that means, you need to keep the string in its original format.",0
10858,"the other thing is, everyone and their grandparents are using pdo, you might want to start playing with it because it really does make you immune against sql injection.",0
10862,this approach has some issues though.,0
10869,"hence, option number one is a no go if performance is your concern.",0
10870,there is a cost to the analytics involved with regular expressions.,0
10873,"firstly, nothing about rewriting urls makes them secure.",0
10874,it is simple security through obscurity and making things look pretty on the client side.,0
10882,"hence, while perhaps it is more manageable (easier, convenient) to filter/validate/breakup/extract/ the larger string in php (say, with a method in security class of some kind), you still need to do work for each piece, for every request.",0
10883,option number one saves you the trouble of having to break up the larger string for the cost of executing the regex engine on every request.,0
10893,apache is a strange animal when it comes to configuring it.,0
10894,"but, if you understand urls and regular expressions, i say man/woman up and go for it.",0
10899,you read every line of the data file.,0
10902,some things to consider: a blank line at the end of the file could cause this if it only happens once (not each line).,0
10903,if you want to have default values in case your data is missing seperators you can add,0
10910,you could verify that $_server['server_addr'] == $_server['remote_addr'] to check if the request is from the same server.,0
10914,"besides that, you should really think through the design.",0
10915,why can't you access the data directly from the first php-script (now containing the curl)?,0
10920,each method of mysqli can fail.,0
10922,"if one fails, think about whether it makes sense to continue with an object that is not in the state you expect it to be.",0
10931,"if they are false, you need to output $mysqli-&gt;error or $statement-&gt;error respectively.",0
10932,"your $stmt-&gt;fetchall(pdo::fetch_class); is returning a array of objects.to access properties of objects you should use -&gt; , so try this:",0
10937,no warning is displayed so something wrong must be in other parts of your code.,0
10941,"that applies whether the text you are using comes from a submitted parameter, or from the database, or somewhere else completely.",0
10947,htmlspecialchars would work in both cases.,0
10952,most likly ifttt can't access your nas from the internet due to home router firewall etc.,0
10983,"i believe this is what you need to send post values from one php script to another, without using js, if you absolutely don't want to use $_session though that is what you should be using.",0
10989,as a bonus your output is smaller.,0
10990,(though it does mean you have to ensure you're actually serving your page with the correct encoding.),0
10991,"(*: there are a few east asian multibyte charsets which can differ in their use of ascii code points, so if you're using those you would still need to pass a $charset argument to htmlspecialchars() .",0
11004,"the suggestion to use stripslashes() may well make this problem ""go out of sight"", but it does not fix the underlying problem, nor does it attempt to address a potential issue of you using magic quotes, again why not to use magic quotes .",0
11005,"just turn off magic quotes , for fixing this issue, other security concerns, and the fact it is depreciated and you shouldn't be using it in code which may not work on a newer server or from an server update.",0
11044,"you can do this with an array, but first of all do not build queries this way since you'll be vulnerable to sql injection.",0
11052,"otherwise, they disappear when the script ends.",0
11053,you use session variables to store variables across pages.,0
11069,here you will have the benefit of validation where false is returned when someone passes a value that is not an integer.,0
11070,if it is instead a float use filter_validate_float instead.,0
11084,"if the form is not being printed to the html, it means that:",0
11086,"the submit button is also missing a / at the end, but that is not certainly the reason.",0

11100,"or everything you can only do - is just point to the article and nothing more, huh?",0
11103,starting the session in logging.php also should be fixed if not in global.php.,0
11105,if you want leave only session_start() but remove it from login.php and profile.php.,0

11131,"check demo1.php on line 2 , it produces some output.",0
11135,also if $link is null and $_post['ajaxfeedback'] is not set your code just sets session values.,0
11140,all you need to do is $_post[$i] since it is an integer and not a string.,0
11155,and form an array with the default values (say 0):,0
11168,the only thing you need to do is associate a key to the value you want (or vice-versa).,0
11174,or even better yet you can just call array_merge once and pass it all the values,0
11178,you cannot read a cookie in the same page request that the cookie is set.,0

11243,"first of all, correlating by timestamp is definitely not a good idea.",0
11249,"when you add a row to the table, you leave this column out (or give its value as null), and the server will automatically assign a value that's 1 higher than the last value assigned.",0
11252,you use this to correlate the two tables.,0
11256,"the way this is handled is by giving them named ending in [] , e.g.",0
11264,"first, use parse_url instead of explode to separate the hostname, path and query string.",0

9145,"there are esoteric stateless solutions where you can do this but with the data encrypted or cryptographically signed, however the simplest solution is to use sessions - add session_start() at the top of all your pages and any data you want available across requests can be stored in the $_session superglobal.",1
9154,"$_server[""remote_addr""] is the best you can do to find out the client's ip address.",1
9162,an important thing you should never do is to insert values directly into the database.,1
9257,better yet would be to use named placeholders and pdo.,1
9258,"using pdo means you don't have to worry about things such as sql injection, and it allows for far cleaner sql statements, you don't have to be throwing values from php directly into the sql.",1
9376,"pdo (and mysqli) bring prepared statements and parameter binding which is far superior to query string concatenation (which is what you're using, sort of).",1
9392,"as mentioned in the comments, you should be using prepared statements to protect you from mysql injection.",1
9413,"also as zan mentioned, don use mysql_* functions, but mysqli_* or pdo...",1
9418,"don't use mysql_* commands, try pdo ou mysqli instead.",1
9437,opening note: mysql_ has been deprecated and replaced by mysqli .,1
9438,the use of mysql_ is highly discouraged.,1
9476,"you should use quotes in array index : $_session[custno], $_session[name] should be $_session['custno'], $_session['name']",1
9489,"also have a look on prepared statements for sql queries, you do not want to have possible injections.",1
9511,you have to use array_search() instead of in_array() to get the key of the found element.,1
9651,call mysql_real_escape_string() on any strings you are putting directly into sql statements.,1
9685,"if starting something new from scratch, best use a database wrapper that supports prepared statements like pdo or mysqli.",1
9731,you should be able to use ifnull to convert null s to (say) empty strings in your where clause.,1
9888,it is recommended you switch to mysqli or pdo for any new development.,1
9960,"plus, i recommend you use mysqli_ functions with prepared statements , or pdo with prepared statements .",1
9964,using $_cookie does not access the client's computer to get the current cookies in real time.,1
10006,"like the call to session_start , the call to session_regenerate_id should be done at the beginning of the script, before anything is sent to the browser.",1
10036,"also, if you have any other code in this specific page, make sure you have exit; after the header() function to prevent it from executing before redirection.",1
10037,since you are using pdo (a very good job there =) ) you can't call mysql_* functions.,1
10055,you don't need to use htmlentities before storing data in the database.,1
10071,"when you unset the reference, you just break the binding between variable name and variable content.",1
10077,"if you're using strpos to exclusively test for the existence of a substring, you have to use the strict === and !== operators (note the extra =), which not only compare values but types as well, where 0 !== false will evaluate to true.",1
10284,"on windows, the php_eol will default to \r\n , while on linux it would be \n only.",1
10306,"the best secure way of connecting and handling database queries that exists now is, either via the mysqli or pdo interfaces.",1
10368,add error reporting to the top of your file(s) which will help find errors.,1
10411,one is to use array_values to re-index the array:,1
10422,session variables are useful for persistent data.,1
10442,you have to set the cookie before any output to the browser.,1
10486,"if any part of your sql statement comes from a request or form submission by the client, you need to sanitize/escape it.",1
10490,"and you have an sql injection error, you should switch to pdo (or mysqli) and prepared statements with bound variables.",1
10524,otherwise you can use unset($_session['user_id']); to unset a single session variable,1
10626,"try to add session_start(); at the top of the file right below &lt;?php where u defined the index() function, if i'm right the sessions didn't even start (idk), but try to add it..",1
10734,note :- mysql_* has been deprecated use mysqli_* or pdo,1
10754,you can then access them on any other php page with the session_start(); code on top.note however that this session data gets deleted when the user closes his/her browser.,1
10766,basically you specify an array to array_unique and it gives you unique items out of the array.,1
10854,"you did protect from mysql injection, but the string you stored is way off from its original format.functions such as strip_tags, htmlspecialchars and trim should be used when you are pulling the string out and echoing it.",1
11023,"since you're utilizing mysqli use prepared statements instead of interpolating query strings, which leaves your code wide open to sql injections.",1
11037,"if you want to interpolate a variable into a string, you have to use double quotes, not single quotes.",1
11128,use an auto-increment for the primary key of your table (the id i assume); switch to pdo or mysqli and prepared statements (the mysql_* functions are deprecated); add error handling.,1
11191,"you should never use values you get from a user ( $_get , $_post or $_request ) without sanitizing them.",1
11294,"firstly, please use something like pdo or mysqli's prepared statements.",1
11368,"your database knows best which charakters to escape and how to treat which data, so just use the escaping and quoting functions provided by your database-api or better: prepared statements (just use them always when interacting with the database + userdata) as they work differently then normal queries and you don't have to think about escaping and quoting.",1
11491,"first, don't use mysql_ functions, as they've been deprecated since php 5.5, and removed in 7.0. use mysqli_ functions instead, or pdo.",1
11548,"ps: i noticed that you're using mysql_* functions, which are deprecated.",1

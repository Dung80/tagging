0,This hotel was very modern and sleek.,0
1,"Beautiful, well-laid out, albeiit small rooms.",0
2,"Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,",0
9,But the rooms are small and not very functional.,0
12,Not really our scene.,0
15,"Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.",0
19,"Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.",0
25,"The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel,",0
26,though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels.,0
27,Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide.,0
30,Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!,0
31,During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight.,0
52,The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.,0
58,but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms.,0
63,"Do not expect any kind of luxury at Artotel Berlin Mitte,",0
64,"it is only a basic hotel, but with a convenient location (50 meters from the metro, 2 metro stations from Alexander platz).",0
69,The hotel is ideally located.,0
72,"No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain.",0
75,"Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.",0
78,Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.,0
79,We turned the cushions over.,0
81,"Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.",1
82,"Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..",1
101,"This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel.",0
103,breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous,0
108,and the room was small.,0
115,"My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB).",0
117,"If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.",1
120,We had a great time in Berlin,0
125,but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed.,0
126,I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed,0
132,It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable.,0
135,3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.,0
139,and the food was really not good.,0
152,I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included.,0
165,"the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).",0
167,"the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist.",0
168,Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.,1
177,When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!,0
178,There was also some inconsistency on the service...,0
180,and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate,0
186,They should have closed for such extensive work,0
201,"Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.",0
207,This time I stayed for two nights,0
209,Renovated?,0
213,Forget about the rooms in this hotel!,0
218,"If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.",1
226,I felt I was walking through a sewer.,0
228,"A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.",0
236,"I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it.",0
240,"If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel.",0
246,Bathrooms are even worse.,0
251,"But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.",0
258,"A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,",0
265,"As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.",0
270,I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.,0
272,Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.,0
275,Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.,0
288,"Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay.",0
290,and I the head of the tap came off.,0
292,"This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.",0
294,The sheets were not changed for three days,0
298,I asked for the sheets to be changed three times,0
309,A frustrating and depressing experience.,0
312,I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.,0
313,The room was great with a modern updated decor.,0
316,so I really highly recommend.,1
318,"I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...",0
322,you have been given a discount special!,0
327,But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?,0
331,"I would have been perfectly happy if we had been offered this to begin with, and would have given the hotel a higher rating,",0
332,but I consider our treatment unacceptable.,0
333,"Having said that, I still ranked this hotel a 2 rather than a 1 because the breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the location was very convenient for sightseeing.",0
337,"At the risk of sounding like a line from ""Cabaret,"" everything about this hotel is beautiful.",0
343,We ate at both restaurants.,0
344,"The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.",0
345,"The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).",0
346,One needs to swipe ones room cards in order to access the floor rooms.,0
358,"Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell.",0
363,we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.,0
364,Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).,1
365,They also have a nice pool and spa,0
368,We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture.,0
370,The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.,0
374,"Easy walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Check point _���_Charlie_���.",0
378,"Food _��_ Breakfast _��_ Only had breakfast on the last day _��_ good spread, fresh and presented well.",0
383,"he sent us to the right suburb but the wrong street,",0
385,Overall _��_ This is a typical businessman_��_s / conference hotel.,0
388,Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday.,0
395,Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar.,0
407,The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.,0
408,"There was an unexplained,",0
429,Is this the Hilton?,0
430,There is no turndown service as well.,0
441,and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us.,0
454,Prices reflect what you get.,0
466,Our room was clean,0
473,but we did not try them.,0
475,"Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.",0
476,"The last time we stayed in Berlin (June),",0
484,"Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.",0
492,"They have a wonderful hot breakfast buffet that was included in our stay,",0
493,the dining room is elegant!,0
500,Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday.,0
502,Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window.,0
509,"Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.",0
510,A croissant and coffee around the corner was convenient and good at half the price.,0
511,There are abundant taxis here,0
515,while the location was great.,0
521,"But I was quite surprised at the decor of the room - seemed like it hadn't been updated since the 80's. But to us, this didn't matter.",0
523,Also liked the nice touch of having a bottle of mineral water in the room.,0
530,The only real downside of this hotel is its bar: It is a cigar bar,0
537,I stayed Savoy for two nights.,0
539,The front desk was always polite as well as effieicent.,0
543,Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar.,0
544,It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one.,0
545,"Breakfest is average, It did have a good selection",0
557,The rooms need a re-do.,0
565,Next time I'd stay at the more modern Ku'damm 101(owned by the same owners) or the Kempinski Bristol down the block.,0
573,"The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.",0
576,Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.,0
577,"I am a very frequent traveller,",0
580,and this was our first trip to berlin.,0
589,Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).,0
592,Both a great day out.,0
599,I chose the Palace hotel after doing quite a bit of research on Berlin Hotels.,0
604,but there were some tourists like us as well.,0
606,"Staff are very helpful, attentive, smiling and say hello to you in the morning.",0
617,Cost was on an excellent deal only EU.,0
625,Just one otherword of advice- and not about the hotel.,0
626,We travelled back to london on a Saturday evening.,0
631,Easyjet probably blame groundstaff.,0
638,and the underground or bus often drop you about a half a mile or more from your target destination.,0
643,and further upo the same street towards the synagogue direction.,0
645,Best breakfast place we found (but there are many) was in Fasanenstrasse No.,0
647,BUt it is about 15 mins from Hotel.,0
656,The hotel phone system was down for three days. Staff was rude.,0
657,The front desk tried to charge me an extra day that I had cancelled upon check-in - this was a 30 minute hassle.,0
659,My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin.,0
661,We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor.,0
666,The hotel has a high standard: There is a good pianoplayer in the bar area at night.,0
667,The service from the staff is more than excellent.,0
668,They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world.,0
674,but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once.,0
683,I would not recommend this hotel.,1
685,Half of Palace Hotel has been renovated recently and consists of contemporary landings and bedrooms/suites.,0
688,"Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.",0
692,The hotel can be reached from Tegel Airport by catching the X9 or slower 109 bus and getting off at the last stop (Zoologischer S+U Bahn).,0
693,Close to the hotel are the 100,0
698,"The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/caf�_�_��_s close by are not particularly good.",1
701,though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking.,0
708,The staff seemed nice enough and helpful.,0
709,The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.,0
712,"The TV was very small and not at all modern,",0
735,"Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm.",0
742,"The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door.",0
745,"The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking,",0
747,"What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street.",0
749,The whirlpool was out of this world.,0
750,On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves.,0
758,The price was very reasonable and included daily buffet breakfast and wireless internet access.,0
764,"They have a decent restaurant just off the lobby,",0
765,"and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says),",0
767,"One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street,",0
776,"you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.",1
801,two people need to take turns walking around the room.,0
803,Berlin Plaza has no air conditioning,0
808,Sounded good in theory.,0
809,But then it turns out that there where 2 rooms in my room.,0
810,What do you do with two rooms when you're alone?,0
812,"There where a lot of closets, but I didn't need them as I was only there for a short stay.",0
814,"The bathroom was a let down,",0
820,"My room was on the 4th floor, that had dark and claustrophobic hallways.",0
824,"Tables where not cleaned, and even the food was short in the last hour,",0
826,The next day that problem already occured at 8!,0
831,Instead I got a family room facing a noisy street and a tiny shower.,0
835,"but I heard this is typical german,",0
838,"The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room,",0
840,clean and had a nice view down to the road.,0
857,"only down side is no air conditioning, but open the windows its ok.",0
858,"This hotel is located just off the kurfurstendam str, which is the main shopping street in Berlin.",0
862,"The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Berlin Zoo, and maybe a fifteen minute walk to Postdamer Platz.",0
863,The hotel lobby has recently been renovated.,0
878,"We were told to go,",0
884,"We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks.",0
889,We decided to go back and urgue our case.,0
890,We booked the Berlin Mark Hotel and not the Appt Berlin Mark Hotel.,0
893,they told us it was too late to be moved as we had already checked in.,0
909,They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin.,0
918,Late review for Berlin Markt.,0
920,Hotel was standard 3 stars,0
929,and not interested in any problems you may have.,0
937,The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered,0
941,The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.,0
942,The shower had no height adjustment bar,0
944,Also it was difficult to regulate the water,0
948,and a towel had to be used to turn it off.,0
950,but nothing was done.,0
951,One of the lamps over the sink had blown,0
959,We did notice a room next to reception with more tables and a waitress walking in and out with coffee,0
960,but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast.,0
967,Ideally located and a comfortable hotel.,0
968,"Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient!",0
972,"We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price.",0
974,The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.,0
980,"I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.",0
987,I was also given a smoking room.,0
989,When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change.,0
994,"It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room,",0
995,but I suppose that is just me.,0
997,Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking.,1
1004,and then booked an extra night for the Wednesday night via Expedia.,0
1009,We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road.,0
1010,"No Bar, a makeshift breakfast room.",0
1014,"Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property.",0
1018,we were left waiting until I had to go back to the empty desk to see if somebody could talk to us.,0
1019,"All I could be told was that as I had booked through Expedia,",0
1022,If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks,1
1025,We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block.,0
1041,but the workings underneath are old.,0
1043,all the doors are warped,0
1049,if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.,1
1058,"well appointed,wonderful breakfast buffet.",0
1062,Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!,1
1063,loved it!,0
1066,we were really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel.,0
1069,"Swift check in, so far so good.",0
1081,I do usually stay in 4 star hotel and have stayed in better 4 stars than the  5 star Steigenberger Berlin.,0
1082,I booked online and got a great rate.,0
1083,"Upon check-in, I was shocked at the room we received -- very stripped-down.",0
1084,It was like a 3-star hotel -- of the Quality Inn level.,0
1085,No amenities at all...,0
1087,The towels were so thin and coarse.,0
1092,and what I am receiving.,0
1101,several cracked tiles in the bathroom and the bed was not kingsize.,0
1104,and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!!,0
1110,it seemed a bit like that to me.,0
1112,Back down I went,0
1124,I questioned him why he had taken our wine order surely knowing full well there was no food left.,0
1125,He seemed less than apologetic and asked for payment for the wine!,0
1128,"On the day of our return, with time on our hands, we decided to take the train to the airport and were advised by the bell captain to go via Bundes Platz to Schoenefeld.",0
1132,and strangely enough there was no porter available to help us with the luggage.,0
1134,and we were assigned room 553.,0
1140,The air-conditioning is not that,0
1143,As a Sofitel Privilege customer (their loyalty card scheme) the room did feature a welcome platter of fruit and some mineral water.,0
1144,What it did not have was the requested double bed; instead it had two single beds pushed together with uncomfortable mattresses and tiny duvets.,0
1150,The new room (554) at least had a double bed (but alas still two tiny duvets),0
1152,But at least it was quiet.,0
1154,"Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).",1
1162,"there is quite a busy road going past the front of the hotel, Across the busy road is the Zoo,",0
1163,you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.,1
1165,also 5 minutes walk is Ka De We which is the 2nd the biggest department store in Europe after Harrods.,0
1167,the room we had was quite large,0
1169,The goodies in the bathroom are very high quaility.,0
1173,The staff are efficient and very polite and helpful.,0
1193,Breakfast had to be queued for,0
1198,I would question any establishment who uses this label while not providing basic 5 star amenities in rooms.,0
1203,and if I ever see another fruit fly it'll be too soon!,0
1208,I didn't have any bottled water left in the fridge in my room,0
1212,"I did just that,",0
1215,"It didn't come, so I then had to leave the hotel, walk to a restaurant up the street, where they sold me some bottled water, that I brought back to my room.",0
1219,"Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay.",0
1224,and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.,0
1225,I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process.,0
1237,We had a room facing out towards the aquarium - it's beautiful to look at the fish from your balcony at night.,0
1238,"Although the reception and bar area is below your window you cannot hear a single sound as the very thick,",0
1239,floor to ceiling glass balcony doors are soundproofed.,0
1240,As too are the room doors so you cannot hear any other guests or morning maid service in the hallways.,0
1256,Soap was never replaced during my 5 day stay (they were too small to begin with and I only received one small one for bath and sink).,0
1259,Not a 5 star hotel in any way.,0
1260,Would not stay again.,0
1265,All other major attraction is about 15mins away.,0
1271,I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor.,0
1275,The have a large variety of food which was great,0
1277,Its 25Euros per person other wise.,0
1279,The lobby smelled.,0
1281,but there is a rotten egg smell that takes over at times.,0
1286,My bed was supposed to be a king,0
1291,but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there.,0
1296,"When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it.",0
1311,The spectalular fish tank in the foyer cannot be entered via the hotel- you have to go around several streets to enter it - at a fee.,0
1316,It was everything a 5 star hotel should be and more!,0
1326,"Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums.",0
1329,a very important point since the street in front of the hotel is heavily trafficked at most times.,0
1334,"Breakfast was not included in our Expedia booking,",0
1335,and we thought it was inordinately expensive.,0
1339,"For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top.",0
1341,"But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn.",0
1342,"Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result.",0
1357,The staff was helpful,0
1364,The staff tend to be young and inexperienced.,0
1378,Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights.,0
1387,Wait staff at the bar was very pleasant.,0
1396,Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).,1
1403,"but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott,",0
1413,I arrived about 10 am and was told my room wasn't ready.,0
1420,I have just returned from a five night stay in the hotel.,0
1431,That room was much larger but with worn and dirty carpet.,0
1432,The breakfast buffet is adequate .,0
1448,"I complained but was told nothing doing,",0
1449,"hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.",0
1457,and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe.,0
1460,The staff were very friendly and helpful apart form one (there's always one!),0
1471,I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.,1
1477,"Second, the staff.",0
1490,our luggage just stayed in the lobby,0
1492,(We tried the last part and they didn't care),0
1506,The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers.,0
1507,"Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant",0
1515,there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel which allows you to easily reach Alxender Platz if you r not in the mood to walk 5 minutes... from Alexander Platz u can take all kind of public transports that will allow u to reach all the parts of the city.,0
1518,breakfast was very good.,0
1519,I really advice the hotel,1
1529,but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.,0
1530,a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss).,0
1531,"We got a room on the first floor, used the 2 lifts initially which look more like detention cells, walked through the dark and very green hallway to our room.",0
1538,but the covers only just fit the width of the single beds,0
1540,and even doubling up is not enough so sleeping for us was hard to achieve.,0
1544,and still had traces of what used to shield the balcony along the side so could be quite dangerous as these are very sharp.,0
1549,though but hot breakfasts are more to my liking.,0
1551,"I would say one thing though, coming home when its dark to the hotel is quite off putting as its not very busy at all and very dark in places",0
1557,"If I were coming to Berlin again, I would probably find a hotel nearer the Brandenburg Gate so its more central to all sites and would be happy to pay a bit more",0
1559,Personally the fact that I had major trouble sleeping in the room is the largest factor to decide if a hotel is good or bad,0
1560,and in this case I would stay here again.,0
1565,"and that breakfast was between 7-10,I put this down to me being tired",0
1566,and perhaps a little more 'sensitive' than I should be.,0
1572,Room stuffy so opened window and was literally BLASTED by the noise from the extremely busy cross-roads right outside our window...,0
1575,"no chance for me I'm afraid, the traffic noise was just to great, even with plugs!!",0
1579,You are NOT allowed to help yourself to the cutlery so we had to wait for that.,0
1594,worst luck!!,0
1597,TAKE A PORTABLE FAN.,0
1605,and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.,1
1607,Save yourselves!!!!!,0
1621,"after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick.",0
1622,I was wondering what i was getting myself into.,0
1626,Errors upon checkin.,0
1633,but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about.,0
1648,I even checked in early to secure a room.,0
1651,"our room had been changed to a room with one king bed (very, very small) and a lower floor.",0
1652,Now: I had been told to check in early,0
1654,Not so.,0
1664,I will never stay here again.,0
1666,and the pool smells like mildew.,0
1668,"I was basically told because I booked through Hotwire, I wasn't a preferred customer!",0
1671,There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.,1
1673,Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston.,1
1675,We were here for the Easter long weekend and loved it.,0
1677,and the staff at the front desk were very helpful,0
1685,and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk.,0
1688,"My only complaint is the jaccuzi was out of service and being worked on in the pool area (which is in the basement),",0
1691,"If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view.",1
1697,"You won't be smack in the center of everything,",0
1702,"and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book).",1
1703,"The price was alright as well, at least in comparison to other hotels in Seattle....",0
1704,"Problems: There isn't a moderate / good for family restaurant in the hotel and it is hard to find these in the hotel neighborhood as well, unless you just want fast food.",0
1709,"The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem.",0
1711,"When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....",0
1716,"(It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk).",0
1722,though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed.,1
1725,My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing.,0
1748,"Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour",0
1749,and that we should take a taxi.,0
1762,Didn't get it...,0
1764,It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping.,0
1767,The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive.,0
1768,Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view.,0
1769,"While there are hotels closer in downtown,",0
1773,We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition.,0
1779,I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.,0
1785,"My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers.",0
1786,My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle.,0
1789,Amenities Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub.,0
1791,and people had taken to scratching profanities into it.,0
1792,Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides.,0
1802,This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep,1
1803,but you do not worry too much about quality.,0
1806,and boy were we disappointed!,0
1809,We were travelling with 2 small children (57) so booked one room for us all.,0
1810,The lobby of the hotel is small,0
1815,We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants,0
1816,and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us.,0
1819,The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude.,0
1825,The hotel is located centrally,0
1827,but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey.,0
1843,"Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE.",1
1849,It looks old and not well kept.,0
1850,I called to see what type of room we would be receiving,0
1857,They were very reluctant to help and solve complaints.,0
1880,"The heater roared loudly,",0
1881,and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft.,0
1888,they said they haven't honored that for weeks.,0
1898,but there were a few problems worth mentioning.,0
1903,"We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony,",0
1907,and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located.,0
1909,We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor.,0
1913,It felt like starring in your very own intimate film.,0
1914,"The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed.",0
1917,"Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day.",0
1927,"I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay.",0
1929,"As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort.",0
1938,cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing.,0
1954,and my view was the wall to the parking lot.,0
1957,and I'm used to deal with every nationality,0
1961,"The staff was quite rude,",0
1963,I cut myself and asked for a bandaid,0
1965,I requested a bottle opener,0
1967,Go somewhere with better service.,1
1975,but maybe the next night they would be able to move us to a higher room with a view.,0
1978,Can't complain about the rooms.,0
1983,"It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members.",0
1989,and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter.,0
1990,"Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others.",0
1998,The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub,0
2031,One side of the room is all window with a patio window...,0
2032,not much of a view.,0
2037,The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines.,0
2040,"Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.",1
2044,"If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.",0
2045,I am glad I got a discount.,0
2052,"However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car.",1
2053,You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service.,1
2055,"The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.",0
2058,We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel.,0
2069,The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine.,0
2084,"Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable.",0
2086,It's true that the hotel does not have the frills of other downtown hotels,0
2092,"Although the lobby appears relatively modern,",0
2093,the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s.,0
2101,Internet access is free in the lobby,0
2104,"The location is better,safer,cleaner",0
2115,"The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met.",0
2121,There is no bellhop;,0
2123,That's the worst of it.,0
2127,"I visit to walk around, to shop, to drink coffee and to see the water.",0
2129,"When I first started visiting, the neighborhood was in desperate need of police surveillance at night.",0
2130,"As a single female traveler, I could walk around and feel relatively safe",0
2131,and the front desk kept a good eye on their lobby and the comings and goings of their patrons.,0
2133,"and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.",0
2137,Walk everywhere.,1
2138,They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight.,1
2146,"And if you've always wanted to be a bellboy,",0
2150,Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.,0
2160,Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ?,0
2178,"Had difficulty locking the door to one room,",0
2208,"The room was huge, while sparsely decorated.",0
2212,The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room.,0
2214,The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated.,0
2220,It was o.k. for the money.,0
2223,"They gave us the room we asked for, topfloor with the view to the water.",0
2232,5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough.,1
2250,Several of us stayed there,0
2254,"I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle.",0
2257,"There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider bad,",0
2268,Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!,0
2280,It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.,0
2282,"You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it.",0
2285,"What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.",0
2293,I will be doing this ride each summer and staying at this motel.,0
2294,It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.,0
2300,and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky).,0
2308,It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd.,0
2311,The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market.,0
2316,but we brought ear plugs anyway.,0
2321,"The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle.",0
2330,"However, everything was functional, the price was not bad ($91 plus tax for two queens and a roll away),",0
2331,"and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area.",0
2338,"Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point,",0
2349,"I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.",0
2351,so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle.,0
2356,"Well, we paid only $130",0
2358,We will never book this hotel again!,0
2371,This was actually not too big of a deal.,0
2372,The staff was very nice and helpful.,0
2373,They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.,0
2374,"Being able to walk to Pike Place Market, which took about 5 minutes, helped us out because we had limited sightseeing time in Seattle.",0
2378,"Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance.",0
2384,There were several stains on the carpet and furniture.,0
2389,Now we are having second thoughts of making this trip to just discover a repeat performance of disappointment.,0
2394,and the beds took up most of the room.,0
2396,"Since we were going to be spending six nights, we moved to another hotel with much bigger rooms,Inn at Harbor Steps, which I highly recommend.",0
2397,Location was very central,0
2402,"This is certainly a good hotel,",0
2403,"and a very good value considering the rate we got through priceline.com,",0
2406,"The cost of valet service wasn't really a problem here, but considering the size of the hotel, and the number of guests coming and leaving, there is a lot of congestion in the front and a considerable wait time.",0
2411,They can be seen in the attached photos.,0
2414,"However, for reference, I stayed at the Seattle Grand Hyatt in January 2005 - that was a fantastic hotel - but costs a lot more too.",0
2427,The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location.,0
2430,"There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either.",0
2437,"Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK.",0
2441,I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights.,0
2445,The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton.,0
2449,Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.,0
2451,"This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind,",0
2452,the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in.,0
2459,"I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.",0
2461,I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle.,0
2466,but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.,0
2467,Stayed here for 2 nights.,0
2468,It was expensive (parking is $35/night),0
2469,but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps.,0
2473,and the furniture is contemporary.,0
2477,And the concierge was extremely helpful.,0
2479,but it may cost to connect in the room.,0
2480,The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost.,0
2484,Our room was located on the upper (old) tower floors and in need of updating.,0
2497,"The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold.",0
2501,Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late,0
2503,I did not have time to eat.,0
2505,but it was stone cold.,0
2519,"Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes.",0
2521,I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments.,0
2522,I also left a telephone message for him,0
2528,Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006),0
2540,and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found.,0
2541,This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time.,0
2551,and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there.,0
2555,We got a rate of $99 on Priceline.,0
2556,They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways!,0
2557,"On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room.",0
2571,"The service was horrendous,",0
2578,"The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected.",0
2581,"The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness.",0
2587,shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open,0
2589,I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning,0
2590,and all they said was they were sorry.,0
2592,"and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available.",0
2597,"Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all.",0
2607,About what you'd expect from a four star hotel.,0
2613,Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food.,0
2618,All in all a pleasant stay.,0
2621,Stayed in the old tower 10th floor.,0
2626,"Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all.",0
2636,"State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location.",0
2641,The towels were thin and scratchy;,0
2645,We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights.,0
2653,and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each.,0
2656,but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.,0
2658,"The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.",0
2663,"I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor,",0
2664,the fantastic promo they had on their website ($129 + tax for the weekend) and the location.,0
2670,To make it even better they should add robes,0
2676,We ate at some fantastic restaurants: Tavolata and Union.,0
2678,For breakfast we ate at the market (lots of options),0
2681,and then it was served cold.,0
2686,I called a number of times,0
2691,I asked them why the room wasn't ready,0
2693,and they had no response.,0
2704,I really wanted to settle it all on the phone,0
2708,Holiday Inn Express has better service.,0
2709,No one told us the gym was closed.,0
2724,AND they lost the most important box of the lot.,0
2725,"While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for,",0
2729,"The room was a perfectly normal hotel room; ditto with bathroom -- in short,",0
2731,"they are overpriced, and service in this case was subpar.",0
2736,One small note -- there is a great Vietnamese restaurant around the corner called Bambuza -- don't miss it!,1
2739,and it was my fifth stay in 10 years.,0
2744,It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter.,0
2746,I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb.,0
2751,I have catered events at this hotel,0
2761,"We are usually Westin or W people, but decided to check out one of the new rooms here.",0
2762,Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom.,0
2764,I slept like a baby and am extremely particular about bedding.,0
2767,and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town.,0
2770,Be careful with this hotel.,1
2781,though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did.,0
2784,"They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet.",0
2787,"Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel.",1
2788,There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests.,0
2804,"We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt.",0
2811,It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with,0
2815,and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves.,0
2817,I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure.,0
2819,and service it is right downtown convenient for walking.,0
2821,The best service was from the Valets.,0
2825,It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton.,0
2829,"then I was told that there wasn't one,",0
2832,I gave up.,0
2839,I won't make any effort to stay at the Sheraton again!!,0
2843,The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street.,0
2849,and I was directed to the wrong set.,0
2860,Rooms: Really nice.,0
2865,There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular.,0
2869,"m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching.",0
2884,That did not compensate for the cost to me because I couldn't respond to the fax.,0
2885,Would I stay there again -- Maybe.,0
2887,You can't beat the Sheraton on 6th Avenue in Seattle for proximity to all things downtown.,0
2889,"In one word, PARKING.",0
2892,$40. That's dinner for 2 every night!!,0
2895,"Never heard any of the other occupants, great bathroom and toiletries, fantastic amenities for guests in the lobby (including a great coffee/breakfast-to-go/sandwich place with rockin' breakfast sandwiches at affordable prices) and lots of computers, lots of staff, great bellmen...... but at a normal price of about $350 per room a night, an extra $40 for parking doesn't leave you with a great taste in your mouth....",0
2898,"Now, if you are one of the luckies that has an extra $40 per night to spend....don't hesitate.",0
2900,You won't be disappointed.,0
2904,We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding.,0
2911,I was surprised to see that in such a high end chain hotel.,0
2919,and the bathroom was alright.,0
2920,"Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna.",0
2925,"If it's for business, I guess this place is alright",0
2927,"Our room was clean,",0
2933,but I didn't have time to take advantage of it.,0
2936,Booked Sheraton for one night through hotwire as I extended my stay in Seattle,0
2937,and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights.,0
2940,"Very comfortable bed, lovely furnishings, really large wardrobe, nice ammenties.",0
2942,and although I didn't get time to drink there - the lobby bar looked really inviting.,0
2943,I'd definitely stay here again.,0
2956,Attractive decor.,0
2959,Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went.,0
2962,They had one computer located at the check-in desk,0
2967,"The worst thing was the beds were so small,",0
2978,However you can buy there's $$$$.,0
2996,My wife and I did a lot of walking,0
3005,"This last visit the hotel was packed, so there was a huge wait to check in, even late at night, and with my SPG status.",0
3006,"The room I received was one of the larger suites,",0
3008,The layout of the furniture was spartan at best.,0
3017,We were disappointed when we checked in,0
3020,only to find it was closed.,0
3023,"Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel.",0
3024,"We were supposed to be on the club floor, but had been moved to the union tower as we arrived after midnight I wasnt in the mood to make a fuss.",0
3032,"The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating,",0
3041,"We had an appointment to which we were late,",0
3043,"Room is ok -not great,",0
3044,bed was good.,0
3045,"Location is close to all shopping,",0
3047,Also enjoyed fitness room and pool on top floor- Step-master while enjoying view of downtown with bay in distance...,0
3051,while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk.,0
3057,Avoid the double decker Gray Line tour.,1
3076,Give me a break.,0
3083,The maid insisted on cleaning our room,0
3085,The hotel was very empty,0
3096,It was our first time in Seattle,0
3101,I would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
3104,and I had to wait until after 2:30 to check in,0
3124,Parking was $35 a day,0
3131,The Hotel is in a great location.,0
3134,I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice.,0
3140,The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all.,0
3143,The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me.,0
3146,We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights.,0
3147,The staff were very helpful throughout the stay.,0
3150,I found the place to be quite clean.,0
3151,The bed was wonderful.,0

3155,I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got.,0
3167,"Just returned from a 6 night business trip to Seattle, and enjoyed staying at the Andra.",0
3175,"The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away.",0
3178,Would definitely recommend the hotel: we stayed a couple of nights at the W Seattle,1
3181,One thing: definitely try to get a high floored room away from the building works for the new skyscraper next floor.,1
3183,but some of my colleagues have been near to the construction site,0
3185,Experience @ A Great Rate Three cheers for the staff @ the Hotel Andra.,0
3191,but extremely clean and decor has been upgraded with a modern contemporary look/feel.,0
3197,"The amenities were lackluster,",0
3202,"Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience,",0
3204,Wether that equals a happy stay because of the location is up to you.,0
3205,My stay at the Andra was exceptional.,0
3211,If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable.,0
3226,Good coffee.,0
3231,My friend and I stayed at the Elan in late February.,0

3304,"Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.",0
3317,"It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells",0
3320,We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.,0
3325,"We got down later one morning, nearer 10 than 7, and there was still plenty to choose from.",0
3342,And it fully lived up to our expectations,0
3347,"Staff was friendly and hard-working - yes, many are from other European countries, but all work hard and are very friendly, so I cant see why some reviewers ,and even some hotel-guests we overheard, would mention it as if it was a negative",0
3349,"Breakfast was typical hotel fare, not especially exciting, but fresh, varied and plentiful.",0
3352,Great value in Seattle,0
3357,"The coffee in the room of course was great ,this being Seattle,.",0
3365,We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation.,0
3368,"The hotel doesnt have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel ,pricey but fabulous,.",0
3370,The bathroom is also very nice and quite big.,0
3376,"The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city, easy to walk anywhere, or hop on transit.",0
3391,"The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience.",0
3394,The pod toilet is private enough that you dont feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room.,0
3396,"Now, the only negative about this room...the shower.",0
3397,"Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.",0
3398,This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up.,0
3400,The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures,0
3401,"Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.",0
3404,Cant fault it...,0
3414,"I really cant imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope its true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite.",0
3416,Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohamas Chinatown - but it is very good if youre feeling lazy and cant be bothered to venture out of the hotel.,0
3417,"If youre heading to Tokyo, whether its business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - its all good.",1
3420,Overall Hotel California offers a fantastic value.,0
3422,and the free internet with printer on the mezzanine.,0

3441,"Did have the same problem with aircon but it was stuck on 23C not 25, so not such a problem.",0
3442,"breakfast fantastic, as everyone has said before, and ate drank around the pool most days - certainly no complaints, and given the decent GBP/USD rate no complaints re prices.",0
3445,"For what we paid I have nothing to complain about, and will happily return.",0
3454,The Lasagna Ristorante on 8th is very good as well.,0
3457,Such a great find....we will DEFINITELY be back.,0
3458,An experience of a lifetime,0
3462,Thanks to him I was able to enjoy my stay.,0
3465,"Thier brochure and website rate this hotel as a four and half star property, but at the time of our visit it did not meet the standard of a three star property.",0
3467,"Our decision on this property was made based on the information in the Air Transat Holidays brochure and the Occidental Gran Flamenco website, neither of which mentioned any renovations.",0
3475,There was so much demand that all spots available were filled before 9:00am.,0
3486,"Often we were not able to obtain beach towels, some days the wait was an hour, on others days the staff had no idea when more towels were coming.",0
3489,"During our stay, despite many requests we were never able to persuade the staff to put a sailboat in the water.",0
3490,The constant explanation was that it was either too windy or too wavy.,0
3492,The beach staff at the Flamenco were interested only in selling us the motorized sports that were not included in our package.,0
3494,I spoke directly with Air Transat reservations to assist in choosing a property because this was our first visit to the Dominican.,0
3497,The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.,0
3500,Neither the staff of the hotel or your representative in Punta Cana showed any interest in resolving any of the problems we encountered; we certainly hope that this is not indicative of your company policy.,0
3504,Loved it all,0
3508,"Big enough and confortable for my husband, daughter and me.",0
3527,"As late June is in the rainy season, the air was quite clean.",0
3531,"We recommend visiting the excavation of the Aztec pyramids next to the national cathedral, about a five minute walk from the hotel.",1
3532,"Also, the food at the nearby Cafe de Tacuba is excellent.",0
3536,Check in on a Thursday evening was rapid we chose this hotel on kowloon side as we were there for business.,0
3555,"You can also use the star ferry, pennies, on the Kowloon side which will drop you island side adjacent to harbour city mall which is a good spot to take the classic harbour panoramic photo.",1
3556,I have no qualms about staying Kowloon side the hotels tend to be cheaper.,0
3562,We were celebrating our 1st yr anniversary and the hotel upgraded our room to a King Premiere and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne.,0
3565,Heart of HollywoodO,0
3567,The room was comfortable with a great view of Los Angeles.,0
3572,"Though, there are a significant number of places to eat within walking distance.",0
3589,"There were underground stations five minutes away ,Victoria and Pimlico, but the bus was better and not so crowded.",0
3598,For some reason the radio can be controlled on the headboard of the bed and the speaker is mounted in the ceiling.,0
3605,WAYYY better than my runny eggs and 4EUro Coke at the hotel.,0
3609,Myslef and 10 friends stayed here for 5 nights over the first weekend in December.,0
3614,"Overall a great stay and the shopping was brill, much better than NY.",0
3615,Kind and Considerate,0
3619,We were to attend the Mariners game on Saturday night and were running late as we were coming in from Eugene.,0
3623,We finally arrived around 2 AM as the police never came to the scene.,0
3626,The room was very nice and clean.,0
3637,Breakfast lackluster.,0
3638,See my review of Senator Gran Via where I stayed the preceding week.,0
3641,"It is very well placed for central Paris - 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower, Pont dAlma.",0
3642,Well served by buses and a metro station less than 5 minutes walk away.,0
3643,Plenty of eating places with varied prices all around.,0
3645,Shower area was small though and door didnt fit so the floor got wet,0
3648,The TV was really high up and awkward to see.,0
3654,The mosquitos were not a problem either.,0
3656,We rented a couple of four wheeled dirt bikes and rode up the hillside and through a village.,0
3659,My daughter fell in love with the staff at the resort.,0
3664,The rooms are spacious and the bed and duvet were very comfortable.,0
3669,Good hotel We booked our hotel and flight to,0
3671,"The flight went to Girona, so we got the bus to the station and you could see the hotel from the entrance, only 2 mins walk.",0
3674,"Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the street, we could open the window and look out.",0
3677,"We walked to the Sagrada , the Ramblas and beach from the hotel and we also used the metro.",0
3678,The 2 ladies on reception were very helpful and kind to us.,0
3691,The location is superb and having a tram stop 20metres away is a real bonus.,0
3699,"Knowing the area, I knew I wasnt going to have too much of an ocean view.",0
3710,"Aside from my dealings with the owner ,who was less than hospitable and crossed out my entry in their guest book,, the staff were great and the hotel was clean and modern.",0
3714,We enjoyed this hotel and its location very much.,0
3716,The concierge Charles went out of his way to help us with tickets.,0
3719,"There was only one problem which was a little let down:there was a connecting door to the room next to us and at around 4 oclock in the morning people were talking so loud, that we could not sleep any longer.",0
3724,Two welcome drinks at their bar.,0
3731,They had a great wine selection from all over Italy.,0
3732,"Not a far walk to the Duomo, farther walk to Ufizzi but manageable if you like to walk.",0
3733,"All roads lead to the Duomo, it is hard to escape its gravity.",0
3751,"We also had our own patio area where where we could hang wet clothes, snokel gear, etc. ,seperate patio but not secluded from view of other rooms,.",0
3754,We rented bikes for $15/day from hotel but they were in pretty poor condition.,0
3755,We were able to bike all the way to Blue Beach but it took an hour and was difficult since bikes were stuck in low gear.,0
3757,We swam out to island about 100 yds off shore only to realize that current on way in was very strong.,0
3759,Currents can be dangerous and ther are no warnings.,0
3772,"For all the wealth that flows here, you will NOT feel out of place or of a lesser class.",0
3774,"Sure, there are hiccups from time to time, but just speak up -- they will apologize and go beyond in making things right.",0
3775,Among the finest hotels in Paris -- and the world.,0
3784,"We found the service variable, ranging from very helpful to down right rude and argumentative when we checked in having used a booking service instead of the hotels direct system.",0
3785,Otherwise I would look elsewhere.,0
3788,You can find specials and packages on their website..,1
3790,The staff is awesome.,0
3819,"This hotel ruined not only my weekend, but my vacation and the relaxation I hoped to get.",0
3824,They also gave her some vouchers for a couple of free drinks,0
3826,"The roof top pool, ok is on the small side but the beach is only 5 minutes walk away if you need more water",1
3827,I really could not fault this hotel - the lobby and bar area is spacious and the breakfast had a wide range to suit all tastes.,0
3833,We have never been disappointed.,0
3852,"So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number.",0
3853,It was in the middle of the tourist section.,0
3857,"Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else.",1
3861,"There was an electric kettle in the rooms with cups, coffees, teas, sugar and creamer.",0
3862,The only thing I did not like was the absence of an iron in the room.,0
3863,I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd.,0
3867,When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer.,0
3872,"We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second.",0
3877,"First, he was on his cell phone at the concierge desk and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him.",0
3883,Neither had been made.,0
3896,"Its not a huge room, but we werent in our room very often anyways.",0
3903,The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines.,0
3904,Most lines were 1-3 blocks away.,0
3905,"Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby.",0
3907,We could just bypass all of that with the elevator.,0
3916,Problem #3 At about 9:45am housekeeper enter my room while I was in bed.,0
3924,He should have been the one to resolve the matter.,0
3925,"She left a roll of gabage bags on the bathroom sink, I guess that was for me to do.Overall, I did not care for the service that I recieved.",0
3934,"Its less than a 5min walk from the station, so is a perfect base for visiting florence and surrounding towns/cities.",0
3939,My husband and I stayed here during a conference last week and it was alright.,0
3941,The room cleaning was questionable though as they did not remove empty water bottles the whole time we stayed.,0
3943,I think that towels were just refolded and replaced instead of giving new towels.,0
3947,"If I had to go to Boston again, I may look elsewhere to stay.",0
3949,The hotel staff was rude and acted like a bunch of premadonas.,0
3950,Everyone assoctated with this place thought their you know what didnt stink.,0
3959,"The rooms were slightly outdated, with stripy coloured wall-paper, and country style curtains.",0
3980,Be sure to get the larger room and have breakfast included as it is $25 if you pay.,1
3982,"Doesnt feel like Japan hotel, more like a contemporary Hilton.",0
3984,"If you want out of the hustle more modern surroundings, this is your place.",1
3991,"The wash basin was also located in the bedroom ,not in the bathroom, which struck me as odd and does not help matters when one person is an earlier riser than another.",0
3996,The weather was really tropical and sunny.,0
4002,We were able to eliminate this by opening the patio doors for a couple of hours each day and by keeping the lid closed on the toilet.,0
4004,It was quiet and peaceful almost all of the time.,0
4007,They performed task with a positive attitude.,0
4008,We often observed them singing to the background music.,0
4014,You could be in the sun or in the shade.,0
4015,The water was a tropical blue with darker shading over the coral reefs.,0
4016,There was constant activity on the beach and just off shore.,0
4023,The staff does a nice job entertaining the children.,0
4029,Choose to go to the specialty resturants on other nights.,1
4030,We liked the Japenese and the Steakhouse the best.,0
4035,"Because of the large amounts of water, my room flooded, as did many others.",0
4036,My room was on the top floor and the ceiling leaked badly.,0
4042,"So, if you ever have a bad experience at this hotel and they promise you something, you better get it in writing because Joanna Turmo will not come to the phone.",1
4043,Not worth the reputation,0
4050,If you have been living in Hong kong peninsula you know it is totally different thing.,0
4051,"The cafe downstairs is terrible, decoration is bad and smelly.",0
4052,"the second thing, just over the bridge, is the Hotel Antiche Figure, and what a welcome sight",0
4057,"A good value, with a few kinks",0
4058,We stayed at the Palladium Grand Bavaro.,0
4059,The hotels grounds are immaculate.,0
4068,"Beaches are monopolized by beach huts and restaurants, so dont expect a room right on the water.",0
4069,"No snorkeling right on the hotels beach ,too many waves and no reef,, so you have to book a separate excursion.",1
4072,",Hotel does not have horses, you would book this separately,.",0
4076,There arent enough to go around,0
4077,The more frustrating kink was the hotels dinner reservation system.,0
4083,"We ended up getting a reservation at La Uva, for Wed night at 6pm ,oh well,, but we did not get another reservation the rest of the week.",0
4084,"At first, we were worried, since we were not impressed by the large buffet at the Grand Palladium.",0
4100,What an AMAZING resort,0
4108,I didnt feel that I was treated any differently or missed out on anything.,0
4115,Never crowded and it has both sunny and shaded areas.,0
4125,"We saw a couple of shows ,International and Michael Jackson, and liked them.",0
4134,"If you enjoy a great Marguerita or a Pina Colada, sadly you are not gonna get it here.",0
4135,"Most drinks are made in kind of a big slushy machine, as opposed to a mixer.",0
4136,The bartender just adds liquor to it and here you go.,0
4152,Staff were friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel are stunning.,0
4154,I would definitely love to return to the St Francis in the future.,0
4161,We spent New Years Eve in this wonderful Hotel.,0
4164,"The location is perfect, the staff are mostly fantastic.",0

4188,I was at the Iberostar Bavaro with friends and family.,0
4195,We did Zip Lining which was great and the caribean festival catamaran.,0
4210,"Also it really doesnt matter where your room is located, each section has its benefits.",0
4221,We were able to check-in at 10:30am when we arrived and later in the afternoon received our complimentary snack and drink.,0
4228,We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed.,0
4231,This gives you the basic idea of the city and you can get on and off the trolley.,0
4234,"If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood , at the Wharf, and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse , at Fanueil Hall/South Market,.",1
4243,The location along the cable-car track put me at one end to Market Street and a connection near the top of Nob Hill brought me into either Union Square or Fishermans Wharf in good time to enjoy the many things that San Francisco had to offer.,0
4244,"Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge.",0
4251,My wife and I decided to fly in early and spend a night in San Francisco.,0
4258,Not a huge issue but worth noting.,0
4260,"The bed was very comfortable and the even with the 2 walls of glass, the room darkeners kept in pitch black.",0
4266,"As many people have commented poorly about this resort and others, you need to remember you are not at home, most of the people who live in these countries do not have large homes with 2 cars, a pool etc.",0
4269,"Just thought I should mention this as I have stayed at 3 star, 4 star and 5 star hotels in the Dominican and the difference between them is minimal as far as the quality of food.",0
4270,"If you want Wolfgang Puck, you should stay home to get it.",1
4274,This place was just disgusting.,0
4276,"I was first given room #1, very dark and damp, had a basement feel since it was on the ground floor half buried in dirt.",0
4284,"The rooms are very clean and are the perfect base while exploring the city, ask for a room at the front of the hotel as you get your own personal little balcony.",1
4287,I have stayed here several times for business over the last couple of years.,0
4290,"The hotel is across from Victoria Park, which is great.",0
4293,"Very good internet access in the rooms, and wireless in areas of the hotel.",0
4296,It was included in my room rate.,0
4297,A very large variety of western and Chinese selections.,0
4301,The hotel as such was good with a very good breakfast.,0
4307,The construction noise was VERY loud.,0
4309,"The Ilikai also permanently closed one of their two pools because the adjacent ,Yacht Harbor, tower was sold to another company.",0
4312,"We learned this the hard way, after dining there- Front Desk Staff should have told us of this exclusion on day one but forgot ,?,.",0
4315,The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.,0
4321,"All things considered, the Luna Simone is a great hotel and we would stay there again.",0
4328,When we arrived back at the hotel we had to wait outside for about an hour and a half because the lady at the front desk did not buzz us in.,0
4335,Its a hotel you can feel welcome and at home at--Im convinced its one of the best buys in San Francisco.,0
4337,"Just in the middle of everything...Museums, Restaurants, Public Transport and lots of Shops.",0
4340,"Just Right This hotel is in the perfect location, especially for the touristy traveler.",0
4343,The breakfast buffet is the closest thing to an American breakfast on the Left Bank.,0
4352,The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.,0
4353,She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away.,0
4362,"If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.",1
4368,"However, during high season this might not be possible.",0
4371,Our experience is not isolated if you read the other reviews it happened to another reviewer in March of this year.,0
4372,"However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice.",1
4376,"attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.",0
4386,This is not exactly a tourist hotel but it is clean and comfortable.,0
4387,"It has all the facilities of a 4 star hotel including a business centre, but beware they charge $17 for 30 minutes internet usage.",0
4390,"The rooms have a modern bathroom with shower, flat screen TV, a safe in the wardrobe, a mini-bar and tea/coffee making facilities.",0
4392,"As I said, its not exactly a tourist hotel but then again Singapore isnt exactly the most thrilling place on earth either.",0
4406,"The complimentary breakfast is great, and the staff in there is warm accomodating.",0
4419,You get this money back at the end of your trip as long as you return the key.,0
4426,"The food was mediocre and the selection is small ,compared to other resorts we have been to,.",0
4428,"The Bahia ,Brazilian, restaurant offers a mini buffet selection during lunch time.",0
4432,There was no limit on the amount of reservations you were allowed.,0
4446,Italian - This was good.,0
4448,I ordered filet mignon with a grape sauce but what I got was more of a salsbury steak with gravy.,0
4452,We ordered hamburgers once but the meat looked pink even after it was cooked twice.,0
4454,Resort does not take care of its beach though.,0
4458,Massages - Massage huts all over the resort.,0
4459,These are outdoor and in the open but there is a semi private hut near the 24 hour snack bar.,0
4466,"Tipping - We tipped the maids $2 each day, $2 at the a la carte restaurants, and $2 per bag to the bell boys as they dragged our suitcases up 4 floors when we first got there.",0
4473,We normally go around this time every year and pay about $1500....so I guess you get what you pay for,0
4476,"The rooms are small but very cozy, we would definitely stay here again.",0
4478,Breakfast is a buffet continental repast-- the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh.,0
4482,Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone.,1
4484,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,0

4511,"At the time I checked in, the fron desks said we dont have your reservation and there is no room available",0
4515,I have read from the review that there was this kind of problem before but didnt think this should happen oftenly.,0
4521,"You almost never see anyone else ,apart from your butler who constantly comes to your door - even entering once without knocking,,",0
4526,"Quiet for the most part, the room was adequate but could use some minor remodeling.",0

4995,Dont miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue.,1
4997,The pool was the highlight,0
4998,My hubby and I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Majestic.,0
5003,"Due to the fact that we are experienced cruisers, an all inclusive vacation had alot to live up to.",0
5004,The Majestic did not disappoint in most areas.,0
5011,I cant understand why they dont just hand these out to visitors.,0
5012,"Otherwise you have no way of knowing what the restaurant hours are, rules about the towels, housekeeping number to call, etc.",0

5095,"But it hasnt put me off the place, and it will definitley be our choice of hotel when we return, which I hope will not be too far away",0

5179,"Told us about a vegaterian restruant that had closed down years ago, a dry cleaners that was also shut.",0
5183,The only good thing was the location.,0
5186,Then when it was over and the police came the hotel manager on duty refused to remove the assailants from the property as he said they were victims too when it was apparent these heavily intoxicated people perpetrated the act.,0
5191,Staff are superb throughout the hotel.,0
5195,If you can get the rate this is a great stopover and the staff have a lot of nice touches like getting us some water for the cab ride back to the airport.,1

5555,"We wanted to make this trip special, fun, and the resort ruined it.",0
5558,"However, this resort was highly unorganized and for a 6 GOLDEN Apple rating, we would surely cringe to see a 4-star ratied resort, which must be a sewer with 3 people working per every 1,000 tourists.",0
5560,"We were never mistreated, we just often werent treated at all.",0
5564,"We waited, waited, waited... the entrees?",0

5722,"This happened to me, the bill that the hamburger place was for 200 Dominican Pesos and they charged me $22 USD.",0
5723,"The good thing is that i was complaining to one of the vendors about the price of the hamburger when a tourist police passing by heard my conversation, he asked me if I had a problem, and I told him what had happened to me.",0
5726,"I am not in any way saying dont go, it is a very beautiful country, most people are nice, but, there is not a lot of places to go like in Mexico, where you can take a bus and you are at the shopping mall in 10 min.",0
5728,"In no way do I mean any disrespect to anybody, and if anybody fells disrespected, I apoligize from the bottom of my heart.",0
5731,The connecting roads to this area are in the late evenings and nights a dangerous place to be.,0
5735,"And quietness is worth something I think:-,",0
5736,Lovely little boutique hotel,0
5741,Boston itself is a really easy city to walk around and I would highy recommend it for a short break.,1

5768,The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid.,0
5769,"I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes.",0
5774,This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday.,0
5776,I dont know if this is a way to save money when the resort is slow or what but definitely unacceptable at a supposed 5 star resort.,0
5777,Now on to my main complaint.,0
5778,"The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations.",0
5780,Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat.,0

5786,"As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful.",0
5788,"Would I ever I go back to the Punta Cana, yes, would I ever go back to the Paradisus, definitely not.",0

5852,Paradise Had a 3 night stopover and must say the hotel was brilliant.,0
5862,"But it is a 4* hotel ,by international standards, and is is MUCH better then any hotel you can find in the city centre in that price range.",0
5868,I really do not understand all the negative comments.,0
5869,It is an excellent hotel at an excellent price,0

5969,"I explained how bad everything was when I left, they replied you will have to talk to hotwire.",0

5975,Breakfast available until 10.30 which was also nice.,0
5978,Shuttle from airport worked well.,0

6026,"When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us, while we are on the street.... that she was charging us for extra people....and they did",0
6029,Weve stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area.,1
6039,I decided to stay in,0
6040,"After reading all these good reviews I stayed in first class room ,nothing first class about it; small room, no amenities - shampoo etc available, and after the third night ,they had not changed the sheets, I found a little blood in the sheets.",0

6081,My ten year old wouldnt go in due to it being too full.,0
6087,"Final note, FOR THE MONEY ,$159/nt, and the fact that its right across the road from the main beach, its a decent value for a nice location.",0
6104,I think it was called Ginger.,0
6109,Close to the Leidsplien and other main streets.,0
6115,This hotel will definetly be my choice of hotel when we plan our next visit to Amsterdam.,0

6198,I found the decor and atmosphere very relaxing in the lobby area.,0
6206,I came in around 5 p.m. on Friday night and checked in without any problems.,0
6208,I was on the 38th floor and had a great view of downtown and the water.,0
6209,It really was gorgeous,0
6216,The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldnt agree more with them.,0
6218,I fell asleep fast and woke up feeling really well rested,0
6225,I went back to the Westin to pack up and check out.,0
6226,"Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room.",0
6242,"Staff warm,sincere,would like to think its deliberate to employ these type of people, because it works",0
6243,"Sometimes in Manhattan the hotels lean to business class or carry the attitude that theres more where you came from, consequently you dont get that personal service.",0
6267,The room was clean and quiet.,0
6270,Interior entrance to rooms.,0
6285,"Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful.",0

6347,"I finally got the attention of a young gentleman ,Alex, to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.",0
6359,"Great service, great rooms, soft towels, good restaurants, great buffet.",0
6360,"In fact, the breakfast buffet gave an American, a Chinese and a finicky 5-year-old great choices.",0
6366,"Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off.",0
6368,"The next morning ,Saturday, at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot.",0
6374,We had a nice room on the 25th floor.,0
6377,Everything is close.,0
6384,Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.,0
6401,First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens.,0
6407,A beautiful lagoon to take walks along.,0
6415,THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in KoOlina.,0
6417,When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety.,0
6418,We played the KoOlina golf course and it is well worth it,0
6420,Not on a beach but very elegant lobby.,0
6423,The food is great but the service is incredible,0
6431,"A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket ,along with a few drinks that were for sale, and was also meant to be used as a work space.",0

6444,We stayed with a park n fly rate.,0
6456,But make sure to ask for a high floor if you dont like the noise.,1
6457,This hotel is in the French Quarter not far from Bourbon Str and you can definitely hear the music and noise.,0
6459,"We ate at Cafe Dumonde ,dont think im spelling it correctly, but ask anyone and theyll know what your talking about,, mostly for its historic aspects.",0
6460,They serve the well-known beignets.,0
6463,"Also, there is no on-site hotel parking.",0
6466,We were told that other hotels in the French Quarter charge roughly the same price.,0
6468,"The difference is with the hotel, you have in/out privileges and its the same price, whereas, if you park you car at one of the lots, once you leave, you have to pay again to re-enter",0
6480,I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.,0
6482,Will probably never stay anywhere else in,0
6490,"My son, another aquarian, referred to it as being steam cleaned.",0
6498,"When we called the front desk about the noise factor, the day person told us they did not have another suite and the couple next door was checking out.",0
6505,I gave him an earful and the next thing I know we were upgraded to the Penthouse suite.,0
6509,Yes.It is very trendy.,0
6510,I am not particularly drawn to trendy.,0
6517,"The difference being that if the weather was too soupy to go out, I did not feel cheated stayng in the room relaxing until it cleared up.",0
6518,",In fact, upon my return home I started to redecorate my house because I enjoyed the minimalist aspect of the decor at BP.,",0
6525,My advice to you is stay here.,0
6532,Travel these days can bring an untold amount of unpleasant surprises.,0
6536,Ps. Cant find the camera.,0
6537,Will upload photos later.,0
6548,"The decor of the hotels public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting.",0
6552,It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.,0
6553,"Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queens Beach ,just two blocks from the hotel to the South,.",0
6558,The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise.,0
6559,"The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries.",0
6579,"The Marseilles is 2 blocks from Lincoln Road, 1 block from the Delano and 2 hotels down from The Raleigh.",0
6581,"Theres no scene at The Marseilles at night, but thats OK with so many other options all around.",0
6589,Were off to Perth now.,0
6591,The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable.,0
6594,"The lounge area was opened and looked great - We were able to get on the internet, cook a meal and also wash some very dirty clothes.",0
6595,The cafe had opened downstairs so we were able to grab something light and easy for breaky.,0
6603,"Clean Hotel, Friendly staff, no complaints",0

6629,The animation team was fantastic.,0
6633,I would recommend this resort .,0
6635,The lady at the frount desk admited they have been overbooking pepole for some time and that we are not the first to be in that problem.,0
6637,No way you can trust what you order is what you get.,0
6648,La Luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame.,1
6651,I recommend not staying in room X01-X12 where X is the floor number.,1
6654,"Im used to a firm bed, so my back was sore most of the weekend.",0
6655,"The front desk help ,Timothy, when we were there, was very helpful.",0
6672,The breakfast buffet was the best that we had during our trip--and we were in 8 different hotels during our stay.,0
6683,I stayed at the hotel a few weekends ago while in town to attend my granddaughters graduation from Loyola.,0
6686,The building was characteristically New Orleans and made me feel like I was staying with family or friends rather than at a hotel.,0
6693,"Overall, I was more than pleased with my experience and would strongly recommend this hotel, especially to those traveling on a budget.",0
6695,We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008.,0
6701,"Boy, its going to be tough to write this review.",0
6702,I am not sure I can gush enough about this fine hotel.,0
6709,"We had two rooms, the larger room had a stunning bay view.",0
6712,This is one hotel I could just sit in the hotel room and never leave.,0
6725,Altough we had a balcony over the street it was very quiet at night.,0
6729,The staff were very helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast in the relaxing dining room was excellent.,0
6731,We got a special deal of 200 euros per night and this made the stay even better.,0
6733,All in all and excellent place to stay and highly recommended.,0
6739,The woman at the desk let me know there were 10 minutes left and that I might want to swing through there before going to my room to get a couple glasses to take up with me.,0
6757,No need to look further Just returned from a three-day stay over the July 4th Holiday.,0
6758,"I usually stay at a Starwood property like the W when in NYC, but this time I decided to go for a more personal experience.",0

6764,"The color pallette in the room was very soothing- soft earth tones, beige, brown, merlot.",0
6768,The bathroom was a nice size and had great amenities.,0
6774,"As previously reported, they do provide you with dark chocolate at turndown.",0

6793,"I thought this was a perfect level of hotel for people who just need simple, adequate accomodations.",0
6794,We spent most of our time sightseeing and found the convenience of getting to and from the hotel ideal.,0
6798,Just try it,0
6800,"From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice.",0
6801,"We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in.",0
6814,The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.,0
6828,We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen.,0
6830,"This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.",0
6831,"3, There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage.",0
6844,"The poolside food was vertually inedible, soggiy cold sandwiches, and watered drinks.",0
6847,A Beautiful Deal,0
6859,We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I cant comment on those.,0
6860,"As for the others, the food was okay.",0
6862,I tried a lot of different dishes and found that most were okay and a few were really good.,0
6863,My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good.,0
6867,This way they will be held until you return.,0
6881,"Even though this turned us off a bit ,again for people who dont mind a lil small talk this is no big, we decided that we would still like to come back beacause of the sheer beauty of the resort.",0
6882,"Even if you do not have an ocean-view or poolside room, you are still surrounded by such beautiful gardens and fountains.",0
6885,The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.,0

6901,paradise found Secrets,0
6913,"The cave itself is gorgeous but take a swimsuit and change of clothes, you will be wet and muddy upon completion of the tour and a video of your adventure is available for a nominal fee on VHS, CD or DVD.",1
6917,"A cute parrot show along with a horse show was nice but the highlite of the tour was the chance to swim with the dolphins, at the dolphin and sea lion show you have a chance to get a kiss from a very affectionate sea lion a moment you will not soon forget, and they will capture it on film for you, for a nominal fee of course.",0
6922,"From the chromed elevator to the mysterious Murphy bed, the tear drop trash cans and the dimmable light tower, she was intrigued.",0
6925,"I booked a room with a single queen bed through Cheap Tickets and was happy with Divas responsiveness to my e-mail request to give us two beds , they gave us a room with a king and the Murphy bed, both very comfortable,.",0
6926,Check in and check-out were smooth and professional and the front desk people were always happy to call a taxi or help with a question.,0

6933,We took the Bart from SFO $4.95 each and walked a few blocks to the hotel.,0

7045,We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees.,0
7048,The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.,0
7052,"The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros.",0
7053,Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someones camera.,0
7056,"Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, dont carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, dont let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.",1
7060,"Plenty of food to choose from, some you may like, some you may not.",0
7069,too much money for oh so little,0
7072,We arrived only to stand in a line for 20 minutes before anyone told us since we were Royal Sevice Members we were to go to another area.,0
7074,"Well, all we saw of the ocean was the roof top of another building.",0
7078,"We are then brought to another room garden view with 2 small beds, not acceptable for $100.00 a day.",0
7084,The bird droppings often found in the Mirador Grill usually found on the plates and tables did not help.....disgusting and certainly not acceptable in the light of the bird epidemic.,0
7088,Seems they had a major problem...They were ABSENT.,0
7103,Their breakfasts were wonderful and so was their afternoon wine and cheese.,0
7107,"These wonderful people and anyone else whose names I didnt get, made this a wedding and honeymoon well never forget.",0

7201,"If youre in the mood to splurge, the Royal Hawaiian ,pink hotel, has a great breakfast but it is pricey.",1
7207,"Hot water seemed quite a scare commodity, if you washed mid-afternoon you were alright",0
7219,"We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, theres nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar.",0

7233,The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized.,0
7239,We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant.,0

7364,"It is also located in the Reforma district and in front of the Turibus stop where you can hop on and take a 4 hour tour of the city for nearly 100 pesos per day or 150 pesos for a 2 day weekend pass, which is well worth it.",0
